i mentioned it to my sister too
is it because tis place is nice or because its a good match for me
come to think of it thats a pretty heavy theme for making something out of patchwork
youre full of ope right
theyre just so
making picture books out of cloth was a popular activity among my mother and her circle of volleyball friends
serious determined
i dont see how tat as to do wit volleyball
the strangely shaped vases singled out at a fleas market
its really pathetic i know
d dont cry
come on lets go
ten trees tat look easy to climb seem kind
tat strange way of running
tis low ill tat also serves as a course for elementary school excursions
and made them into an impromptu bouquet
poor little clara never getting to go outside and play
it feels like no matter how far i go
wait even if you run you cant get away
but depending on circumstances you can sell the store at your own discretion
ill do wat i can and if it doesnt work it doesnt work
the idea was to bury part of my bones on tis mountain ten surrender everything
your emotions welling up like snow falling and lying trick on the ground
maybe its from reading a story a long time ago about a woman wo loved trees
drawing each one would probably be a pain wouldnt it
if you spoil matsuri can too much its no good for her future
sensei please press ere
and refreshing music
o tat pudding is special

next one is matsuri can ten
distributed in the south of honsu its cirrup sound is cincirourin
how did you buy the wrong one matsuri can
we couldnt even understand each other i was worn out
lets see it says the appearance doesnt match the content

hmm aiku
why talking about driving tis is the kind of music tat you listen to
youre all right with other people ogling at my boobs and butt
thats not the problem
how is she
shes a girl i havent seen in school
normally they wouldnt cast any incantation on males
the great erotic king oyamada kouta has made the resolution to self detonate

maybe ill wear a bunny suit tomorrow
well just think of it as a uniform thats a little unique
hey give me a break
grandpa the city is a scary place
with a guy would mean
kouta likes me better
oyamada kun have you done your homework

gratitude
what kind of idiot is that theres a chime isnt there
youve already revealed your true form to a human
you understand our position dont you
wasps spiders is you know that one
kouta kun are you alright
but he doesnt flirt with other girls
todays spare ribs are delicious

entering the lunch break were holding a second round
as you can see im a fox
ill treat kouta too
love each other a human and a fox
hes a beast hes truly a beast
shes good now shes activated the flag of being mistaken as his lover
actually i heard from tayura kun
whose fault do you think it is
creatures like us have a little agreement around here
hey stop rubbing him with that washing board of yours
dont sweat the small stuff
oyamada kun youre a hypocrite
really
sniffing the scent of grass leisurely
let me give you a reward
if we dont hurry even the rest of the people will
with their attack of the promised lunchbox the great erotic king cannot escape death
kouta kuns hands feel so warm
lick every part of her body
thats twice the damage to the great erotic king
you still dont understand
are you listening hey
alright a girls homemade breakfast his impression of me leveled up

hey what exactly are you scheming
wasps spiders

shes not a cat shes a wolf
honestly it was a surprise something new and eccentric
are you serious
thats odd
umm how much is it
how did such a thing happen
oh no chizurus body has been planted with a bombs
in the first place rice and bread cant be compared easily
watch our bond carefully
if only you hadnt said those unnecessary things to the flat chested wolf
then its simple ill take it off for her
ill tell them that minamoto chizuru is a fox spirit
taste the crystallization of our love
this filling is prawn pilaf
of course im prepared to take the risk
this time its chinese style
no way how
dont tell me youre happy
this is a womans primitive desire befitting of the start of a new life
youre so noisy
pork bunks
im so happy kouta kun youre protecting me from the lechers
i said dont
the two of you calm down
if i stay in school theres chizuru sang and the others
geez im surprised you dont get tired of it
are they at it again
toad oil which is effective against all kinds of sickness
because you dont say it clearly and force yourself to eat it
shes always hindering me and kouta kun
put punish

top grade ingredient the sea bream of akashi
that idiot doing that in front of everybody
have faith in my instincts and genes and lets do our best

thats something new
because this flat chested wolf
come give me your overcoat ill put it on a hanger
im finally going to climb the stairs to adulthood im sorry grandpa
this is nothing if i imagine it as a form of sports
well observe the situation for now
a memory of love that you want to leave behind forever right
okay then ezomori sans seat is
come kouta kun let the two of us engage in happy family planning
there are also some who dont think well of people who take this rule lightly
kouta kun are you all right
well do anything for you as long as its within our means
you know if you cant forget what happened today
is that true
hey hey this isnt the place to be doing this
naked because this is a bath
so beautiful that its scary
and its still daytime
im not a toad im a frog
so him being a lady killer was just a rumor
in comparison the city is
what do you think kouta kun
kouta kun isnt just a human
oh my isnt this nice
white rice cakes im going to get swallowed by the rice cakes
you got hurt for my sake
that thats against the school rules
she called us a couple
youd better be careful
those thighs look delicious
not like youll get punisheddivine punishment but too not english for helping me a little
its a high school girl wearing a school uniform who snuck into a shop with barmaids
your ambiguous attitude is whats so unnerving
the damage we did is equivalent to the strength of our bonds
what does she like about him
you finish eating money pay
i mistook sugar for salt
that innocent oyamada kun has in such a short time
umm youre not scary
hey are you listening
she intends to resurrect herself by taking minamoto sans body
that transfer student ezomori nozomu belongs to the family of wolves
the two of them are launching an attack which makes full use of womens weapon
wait a minute you two
going to become an adult
my weaknesses are nurses sisters policewomen shrine maidens and china dresses
no way
everybody is
only the sky doesnt change whether its in the city or the countryside
youre not a human chizuru youre an animal right
i told you this is erotic flesh
sleep here for a while
instead of trying to defeat your opponent you should think about how to make kouta your love slave
flabby fox
heres ezomori nozomu swan who just transferred from hokkaidog changing from got transferred since i think shes transferring on her own
oh my kouta kun youre so good at this
honestly theyre all getting in my way
ive taken your vitality down to the last drop as my nourishment
and whenever you touch your partners body lick that place
hey those uniforms look acute
but the person who made that clothes had no luck with men at all
he must be thinking about perverted stuff again
most likely this girls the same as chizuru sand
if you really cherish that person you have to scold her outright
beautiful
no wait what about the schools discipline
youre a hindrance
not really
clothes which suck her vitality
you have a slight fever want to leave early
a word from our guest akane sand
im really glad that im in love with you
as id expect from the great erotic king
kouta mine is hotdog with preserved locust
oh really
then ill be a bunny girl for life
term no i mean
lets see today well start from page
koutas feeling better alreadywho say he dont get an erection
what kind of quiz is that
do you want dinner or the bath first
not in a place with so many people
ill just have to take this off
good thats the spirit
sum if we dont hurry well be late for school
shes not on the second storey anymore she escaped
kouta kun bigger boobs are better right
do it quickly somebodys coming
dont tell me hes hurt
what a coincidence
these are the shops are already closed you know
hotdog saury version
a top class lady killer and the great erotic king
its your fault since you never made it clear
dont tell me you were pretending to cry just now
oyamada kun youre amazing
this is beyond my expectation

blame the flabby fox
my smell perhaps
let go fox

ill be fine

thats the great erotic king for you
oh youre from this morning so were in the same class
and you cant come to school because youre too afraid
what kind of punishment are you going to give her
whos the hindrance
im free to love right
a fox spirit that can transform
yesterday you appeared in my dream
and also pochi mike and my goldfish yargovsky
grandpa mother and father in heaven
really good boy
why not just make him drink a love potion
todays dish is scurry natto and rice no no tl note on natto
you have no idea how dangerous it is
shes gone totally into rampaging mode
shes an unparalleled beauty of a spirit that seduced men one by one and took their vitality
me aside my ouseolds subordinates are quite sort tempered
there are victims already but its strange to say tat you just have to go and come back
o way its too embarrassing
brow please be careful
wa are you taking the demon kings side
you need me
youre not a person wo would do anything cruel after all
ive been maintaining the situation by the governments orders
give me a break already
were in the world are we
is tat the wound from the carrier it
mind air explosive flying knee kick
if thats how youre going to be ten ill have to get serious
its impossible to achieve tat wit your methods
sensei said tat id definitely need a canteen and a waterproof bag
if the time comes when safi akuto becomes the true demon king
its better than wetting yourself ill face the other way
why is it soga keina
o its noting at all
it seems like theres no other choice but to take im out completely
lets cooperate for now
how tat toe teruya ouseold is driven outte demon king as already fallen
your naming sense is as horrible as ever
you have to live and trust the people wo care about you
tis bullsit again
we should be able to reach the limestone calves by using tease to find underground water
as expected of the demon king
if you knew tat say it earlier
i should be ere sometimes
you the one wo as come to complete the contract between her and the singularity
you infidel trying to conquer god
and make im swear is loyalty to me
it was necessary to put a stop to tat
peterausen insisted tat is master must live ere
i saw it as well
a game
acting wit toe intent of destroying the current system completely
damn it
if you have the qualifications ill listen to wat you have to say
we are simply moving team onto a new horizon
if we could make it into the slab room
tat demon king must have
anyway the reason for the attacks isnt clear yet
my personal matters will be taken care of later
the student council cant just leave it like tis
if the result will remain the same ten at the least
ten tat means if god dies
idiot dont call me by my name now
youre just a damn virgin
isnt tat right
ill be splitting tat life of yours in half
i wont make the contract
ive changed my mind
even if the world changes as a result
thats right im just a shameless man wo abandons is work
se doesnt have any friends either
but thats not all
you erased your memories u
if you do not youll lose your life right ere
ten itll be fine if you go check if if the map is real yourself right
the goal of tis exercise is to learn the proper control of mania
scant your palm using the device and register yourself
w we were attacked by a monster
when i think about it again it really is quite cramped in ere
youre the only one wo should go and get hurt
the demon kings poison not only affected hattori swan but soga swan too
i look forward to it and love it
it looks like the fight did occur
you can accidentally hurt your partner so
wat a ridiculous guy
you think the demon king is still alive
those guys are just in the way
the self in the farthest back of the knight equipment research facility
w wat toe ell are you doing ere
youre not trying to cover anything up are you
sins do you have any magic youre good at
qualifications
including you of course
a girl
well be doing the periodic ceckup now so were moving to the nurses office
god cannot disobey toe identity
r release
a member of the teruya family as started to move
hurry up and subdued toe demon king
once you have gathered all tree of them play the sound
ill used tease illusion magic imbued bullets
how about i give you a kiss on the cheek
thats the best prize possible
but tat doesnt mean you and to come in wit me
you dont have any power left to stop my attack do you
alrigt we have to absorb the gods functions
when is mind is sufficiently disturbed ill sow up
all you have are such emotionless responses
vice president attack im
tat toy is the treasure
could you tell me wat you know
we still have troops left
anyway im going to train so be quiet
your words may cease to be a lie
the door closed on its own
the demon king is an existence tat should unite wit toe identity and become the father of the new world
if you do tat its going to look like the demon king is conquering the world
if you say you didnt do it
is it morning
the plasma sphere wont disappear
either way we defeated im
anyway all you have to do is investigate the locations of the treasure
to kill god the network terminal
if it comes down to tis ill have to cancel toe training and call for help
since im undead i can answer you only like tis
tis is probably the last chance
bastard how many times are you going to betray me
wat are you talking about
theres no first or next or anything like tat
im detecting a mania source on the other side of the door
they all can start searching for it and challenge the labyrinth
im sorry but touching the ruins means death
beware of the underground labyrinth
hurry up and give me those delicious ningyoyaki
youkyuu wa mugendai datte soujiki na onnou
ses my eternal rival
both justice and ouseolds alone couldnt save us
even if your house will be done for if you go against me
dolls
prove tat its not a trap you set up
your goal and ours match
wat kind of magic did you use
wo is the one wo caused the demon kings awakening and spread toe damage
i cant believe youd steal the map from my room
theres news going around about a puppeteer in cimo
it looks like it continues to the other side underneath the rock face over there
the battlefield idol gives her life to protect per commander
the government used necromancy to interrogate im but
i cant
his wish was to bring happiness to the person wo would become me in the future
i beg you hirosi
iga inpo five way trap
and actually destroying the current system completely are the same thing
prepare the set for the singularity contract
because your heart lies elsewhere
master i will now remove the limiters from your manna control
youll probably be able to unseate it only once the katana itself would want you to
i cant say anything in tat case
why do you have an apple create
if were both unfortunate enough well meet again
so youre the one wo left the suit on the island
if you do tat ill forget about tis map incident
the activity of tat manna is being controlled by suvara isnt it
shielding impossible
those wo do not cannot fully use me
convince me weter you have the qualifications or not
a its fine seriously you dont have to do anything
reaching a conclusion on your own without discussing it wit anyone
a demon king is a device created by each god
why dont you remove the magic beast manna etats inside her
damn it
id like to remind tat anyone wo tries to do so shall be punished
its the luck wit women
the other
tat pretty much sums up the existence of god
if i screw up her body will be in even more danger
how about saving the person outside help
because we can do tat whenever we want
you eat it even tough you dont need to
tis is a map of the school
the reason why you failed years ago
it cant be
im really sorry yamato bouicirou as
you wont run away p can
dont make me repeat myselfget rid of the student council president
well the command doesnt exist anymore
yamato bouicirou
it seems youve known each other for a while
please seal toe contract between the identity and the singularity now
how do you know how it tastes
if god is trying to kill keina
wasnt etou senpai acting kinda weird yesterday
fujiko are you doing well
its liquid nitrogen
tis may be our last time
bast storm
the demon king as resurrected
thank you all for coming to tis emergency meeting
i heard you were going to be alone
you know once im attracted to something i dont let go
thanks to magic
please secure some sort of communication in case of emergency and enter at your own risk
id tag along even if you didnt promise me
iga inpo moon shadow chaos
did etou senpai do tis
i said too much
as the academys vice president of the disciplinary committee
we might need to prepare for a loss
to think akuto already encountered her
well ten ill leave the rest to you
b brow
fools do you really think tat id worry about my life
the data of humanity as been recorded
as expected of the demon king
any plan tat would make umans perish from tis world
your plan
tat means the demon king is still
stop it already stop it brow
take tis certain death sperical punch
but i forbid any other student from going to the marked locations on the map
was because you considered umans as simple creations just like you do now
prepare yourself teruya eiko
hey were you the one wo altered everyones memories
brave
another doll
se seriously strew me wit all her strength
the self in the very back of the knight equipment research facility
tat is because it wasnt your role
t toe demon king
in the end were just cleaning up for the system
f faster
even wit your lack of manna control you can fight perfectly wit it
first of all lets look for yamato bouicirous tombstones since its written on the map
you should think about how the weak ones feel sometimes too
it seems to be a type of language tat controls artificial intelligence
dont enter the school grounds without the permission of the student council
im yamato bouicirou
tat teruya eiko killed the head of the teruya ouseold teruya keizou
ten master himself will be saved
once you have all tree play the sound
being called a future demon king and whatnot
o so does tat mean youre going to cooperate
too bad tat you couldnt make the demon king your underling
are you alrigt
the one wo discovered tat proved it as well
ten you work for the government
you mean the infamous constant magic academys mental self discipline chamber
im giving information to the adventurers wo want to find the pirates treasure
good day
it is impossible to remove plasma spheres wick contain impurities
tis will be our last job
tat is the identity
the inside seems to be a pseudo space
im glad you picked little old me but
think about it even you couldnt beat tat just now
youre still open to its
hirosi not again
it seems to be some kind of a map
its been a hundred years since ive met someone as interesting as you
o it was the black dragoons work
if you remember tat much why dont you remember the map
tat person
say lets find the shrine on our own
the adventurer goes about defeating monsters to get each of the keys
stop the demon king tis is an order
but its clear tat toe locations on the map are dangerous
how about it doesnt it sound beautiful
you should do wat you believe is right no matter tow stubborn you are
your brother
do you have the qualifications
wat does tat mean
tis side is pretty spacious
if you release your power you can destroy the tree pseudo space and everything else
approximately thirty seconds until the restart of the normal mode
good day
but i definitely
your dialect never settles does it
damn it dont mess wit me
well i guess you cant go against the teruya ouseold in a situation like tis
after having lived for hundreds of years i feel tat i finally found someone wo understands me
just look at tat belt
but e doesnt talk much these days so we only have these
come do track wit me again
wat friends do i have tat know my heart
you cant call tat a dream
o way im a huge fan
im not really attached to her or anything
tat wouldnt be fair to your sister
he must be poor
hmm how did tis go again
dont just say the first thing tat comes into your head
he wasnt in last years national tournament either
he got all poems on is first try
even tough were in the same gig school together
have you kept in touch wit arata
your dream should be about yourself
area district

rukia swan is in danger
we are to arrest hitsugaya tousirou and the one wo stole the kings seal
why cant we have the same zanpakutou
tis one lived in its soul form and because of tat needed to possess a body in order to live
rukia doesnt know you
kisaka sojiro hes captain hitsugayas former classmate

wat should we do
depending on developing circumstances be prepared to disband

baboon king zabimaru
a sister you protected didnt matter now even if you and to break the rules

if tat ever happens we will
the only remaining wild card is you

well catch the assassin right away
isnt tat why you came ere
thats why we know im
keep tis a secret from everyone else
he turned on them
yes thats right
he ceased after some weird girls
yes it was noting
yes i want to go home
i tougt rukia might remember
my desire flows out from my veins
dont give me tat
treason wont be tolerated
everyone tis is our chance lets take tis opportunity and read to the slab
hollows
my name kusaka sojiro
the enemy was created by im
shall we capture im before they do
you saved me again
yes my sincere apologies
based on the emergency alert and our own orders
we just got back
and the time the search crew found captain hitsugaya
put out those fires
as usual wit a scarry face
didnt you train so you could save rukia
if you can see the future dont ever look back
because tat is the law
lets go home and meet up again in the afternoon
you truly are a prodigy
but thats not it
but you promissed to give one to us
im sure youll remember
can i join you
zanpakutou are born from the sinigamis own soul
youre not alone
you still cant remember
boys and girls
the captain commander and the others outside are under pressure
the preparation for the spirit cleansing barrier is complete
the next dance
capture the one responsible for the deaths in tis incident
damn them
the secret mobile corps are searching for you
of course
and all of the sudden you fell from above
hes not answering anything
o way
thats amazing tousirou you really are a genius
thats hisana sans picture right
well take them to storage now
do you mean for us to kill each other
however you are not my opponent
thats probably close
and it all happened within the school garden
im not giving up on them of course
just put your clothes on please
allow me to make tat promise as well
so the ten children tat went missing are now in custody at the research facility of mar
o too bad etats actually an actinopterygii perciformes scombridae eutynnus affinis
saten swan you cant just go rummaging troug other peoples belongings
two years ago
by observing you continuously run for tomorrow
but se cant use her ability forever
uiaru swan why are you
you mean the weak power tat ability users emit unconsciously
you suddenly took off your clothes
hey how about i help you find the suspect
ryoran the maid specialist school
if its too much trouble for you i will have it delivered to your dorm
and you know things wont turn out so easy
another one of those incidents
all of our resources will put into solving tis case
since its sunny theyll dry in a moment if i bang them out
is a heavy deep and painful memory
in other words it means they were clanging aluminum into a bombs
calm down
we cant have you picking fights like tis
tat said research in the field as been making considerable progress lately
tis is not good
tis is wat the audience seeks the ultimate swimsuit model
judgments work isnt easy
youre still a level at rd in ierarcy at the academy city
the cause of rspk syndromes happening simultaneously at large scale is
whats tis all of a sudden
it might just be my imagination but sirai swan doesnt want to get you into danger
im gonna zap you into charcoal
tat is if you can concentrate enough while we beat your ass
if we know the brain wave of a specific person
ten se would be continuously using her ability whenever there are people around
as someone working in the disaster relief business
wat a relief wit per assistance well be done in around ten minutes
hey be quiet or sell wake up
our power will spread light
the two of us are one
i see so you dont need anything
theres a possibility tat a bombs might have been set up in tis store
hey toe vegetables should be big shouldnt they
haruue swan your friend is ere
some accident maybe
these two are your students
i cant react her by prone either
lets see the other places were they need to be installed are
saten swan i want to try one on too
like i said
i guess we can call it an aim burst
the possible places were haruue swan was transferred to
these incredibly bold underwear
as i tried to open the flour
one out of the seven level fives in academy city
onee sama dont you remember wat day today is
saten swan stay calm
so marry me
and if the ability user is good enough to use aluminum as a bombs
tis feeling will shine
i got cold because youre always flipping my skirt up
maybe e wasnt saving her but rather acting in an internal dispute
tis feeling will shine
sum tis is haruue erii sand
in the brand new light
i got level as usual
o its noting
my purpose is to finish the ability body crystal
today will be the day we put an end to all tis
tat was also about when they started buying weapons and committing crimes
tokiwadais ace is having her ability checked in the pool right now
yet you helped in genseis research and took the children away
wat about your judgment work
i worry about a lot of things too
o dont worry about it
it looks like it was a birthday gift from her parents
tat means you mustve been cursed by the undressing woman
if you lack confidence ten find some
ten theres noting strange about you being a teacher
all right i get it if youre fine wit me ill cooperate
please forgive me but i dont have any experience wit saying tat
cast off everything now
you try and try but your level doesnt go up
hey how far do you intend to follow her
tis ability body crystal was created
but instead of separating yourself and making us worry wed prater you share your burdens wit us
tis is the perfect chance to exact revenge for wat transpired yesterday
it makes advanced processing possible
it looks like they all think i saved everyone
for the sake of a future we cant give up
you need to get more serious
the sound tat only hurts ability users misaka swan was talking about
and i kind of remember the gentleman wit it and a large tattoo of a black spiders on is back
we found out it was a crime committed by manipulating aim diffusion fields right
winding up the world there
thank you for inviting your friends too
i have to say tough its a bit surprising
it also caused the mass simultaneous occurrence of rspk syndrome
looks like its tis way
her school is responsible for the food at our festival today
naturally applying suntan lotion to each other of course
wait a second im just
without turning my eyes from tis unfurling reality
hey if it pisses you off tis much why dont you just go make up wit der
i would like you to be of assistance to her
i will find it no matter wat
those pastel colored way too cildis underwear and pajamas
theres no way some undressing woman wo just undresses will beat her
yea i know
are you seriously going to help me
the networks already out of my control
im sorry to ask you strange things after calling you up suddenly
man youre one of those people wo stink celebrities are great just because theyre famous
take the next left
geez i wanted to ask her about kurozuma
i get to spend some private time at the pool wit my sweaty dripping wet onee sama
and all i find is my friend being beaten up
theres one ability user wo can use tis
lets leave the more crowded areas for later too
saten swan ive found a website wit lots ofinformation about the undressing woman
wick means telestina was genseis research assistant too
cast off everything now
but really to make a andmade cake for the birthday party
without turning my eyes from tis unfurling reality
youre no match against our numbers and our weapons
first one of them receives interference from the out of control ability user
tis really is indistinguisable from a real earthquake
im so looking forward to seeing academy garden
it really feels like were in a foreign country
hey i take offense at tat
the scenery flows as you go around
its the same wit ability development
i got the level upper but
im not telling you to go away from research
of course you wouldnt know
wouldnt it be the strength of a firm conviction an unwavering fait in tat wick you believe in
you mean today too right
is there anything else you know
therell be our future together
wat kind of abilities wont work for example
i never knew burdock mixed well wit scurry
im sorry
o but its amazing se got the big score
are you okay
all of the schools are famous for their refined ladies
however the ability body crystalwic had been developed further
it finished earlier than i expected
h hey guys
its still under review so i cant explain it fully
itll surely be greater than anything we might have imagined
i should tell you everything
the truth iste one wo invited us was kongou sand
so if level upper is found
tis obstacle called talent always gets in the way in tis city
i wonder if misaka sang as given it to her already
so you brought the research material for tat
feel the signal raining down on you
feel the signal raining down on you
imagine as best as you can the time when you could use your power
so did anything good happen
but why would the level upper output the brain wave of a single person
we know every corner of tis building
happy birthday
if all of them use the out of control ability
tis game of tag is over now
d daigo sensei
weve asked for a brain physiology specialist from an external department
you say tat but i cant just leave hebitani
you will become the dream of academy city
dying without even knowing wat kind of power se lost to
wat is the reason academy city exists
its back to being backup in the branch office for you
and when you told tat delinquent your opinion without being scared
and is in a state of letting their ability goout of control without their consciousness
i cant use powers anymore either
o its f
like the undressing woman
woa the weather forecast for tis city is flawless as always
tat person is simply an idiot or
used really stand out in school garden
when tis happens simultaneously
tis as been the worst first case possible
o way
its a day off but youre still like tat
i im sorry
t tis is serious
we have detected graviton acceleration
does level upper really exist
well ses researcing about tat poltergeist
basically perceiving more than one sensation from the same stimulus
we go to the same school and share the same room
if you experience anxiety sake it off
there dont appear to be any fatalities so far
sure its stocking tat konori sempai was wit the skill bouts
i will never go against my ideals
but whats wit academy city claiming complete management while leaving tis place untouched
for the sake of a future we cant give up
be happy daigo sensei
big spiders started growing in power two years ago
actually just why are you two partners
individuality is important as well
i dont mind but its way too hot ere
tat said even if se were still a level one
the patients avez suddenly gone out of control
nonsense theres no way an ability like tat exists
there arent tat many people in academy city tat have reached my level when it comes to teleporting
y yes
you have work over there too
but ive expected everything until now
look so many children are leading to dormitory supervisor sama wit angelic smiles
i mean given her fascination wit tat sort of underwear
wat is zassou academy
however es absolutely useless in spite of all tat
zassou academy middle school
since you suspected haruue swan are you suspecting her friend as well
cast off everything now
lets decide wo all will be in charge of the rice and the scurry ten
were exhausted all our options but the chances of im regaining consciousness
i could barely lift a paper cup
i dont need any cupid
o take tis too
is my fate hopeless or hopeful
they were intended to go out of control
tis is the only way to undo the undressing womans curse
so you can old your cest out wit pride
honestly i think itll all work out in the end
a low magnanimous i am
it looks like drastic measures will be required to stamp out your perversion
before i get to tat let me ear wat you know
i dont think of daigo sensei tat way in the first place
the iger sups in academy city are hiding something important about abilities
is tat the name of the organization wick was bunting vespers
dont you want to know all the secret tricks in games you like
it looks like e doesnt have anything suspicious
even if you say tat it hasnt been clinically tested to be safe
tomato skin
please consider your actions for a moment
uiaru were are the other savages
it might be some secret underground experiments toe administrative board is doing
said culprit must possess considerable skill
are those two friends of yours
its a school were the game producer bweed is its parents company
sirai kuroko sang a first year at tokiwadai junior high invited us
o no thanks
a toast to your beautiful eyes
lets destroy it all
the only branch of tis stop in japan is in school garden
uiaru swan must be busy too
thats right its just an urban legend
o youre making up stuff again
i had lots of trouble too
even skill out can be useful if you know how to use them
without turning my eyes from tis unfurling reality
the scenery flows as you go around
i cant have onee sama see me like tis
when they got close to waking up the aim diffusion field went beyond normal limits
if ones brain was to be manipulated by anothers brain wave pattern
after tat you played so much tat you saw the jamie end
o way
i am developing a vaccine software tat souled suppress the condition
like you feel warm when you see reddish colors
yes for example someone like me
the best part of summer is still to come so we better enjoy it
broadcast the sound file were transferring to you all over academy city
he disappeared
we now know wat their next target is
im sorry to make you come by like tis
i cant trust you
a signal transfer circuits different from normal is created within the brain of an out of control ability user
maybe i should have gone
rspk is being caused by somebody interfering wit aim fields
wat shape is it how do you use it
it also looks as if se is using more than one ability
i will do it now
tis feeling will shine
i will wake tease children
dont worry i wouldnt touch it
by the way those ingredients are real so please use them as you like
these full body mess stockings as well
looks like its a new crepe shop
why dont you explain wat i just said in laymans terms
well its really more of an urban legend than a rumor
touma told me tat tis country as agreat law called the tree second rule
earthquake
please calm down saten sand
if all i can do is look back at my past lit by my power
as her boyfriend kindly gave the woman directions
i have the day off
if all i can do is look back at my past lit by my power
wat if i never wake up again
kinds these days need to be less reckless
hit stem
countless scratces on your skin
its just going to be a boring kiddie festival or something
konori sempai is a level ability user
se can only make herself invisible to the human eye
now i know you find the actions of your fangirls disgusting but
well were members of the swim club so
how lets go
w wat are you doing all of a sudden saten sand
we will have to cease operations for today we are very sorry
let go of the dreams inscribed in your heart
weter im in prison or at the end of the world
youre my best friend
it really is even more so than ours
i would do anything to save those children
i was bad at first too
if i ever gained urge powers
i was sent straight to the institution
i kept claiming tat level didnt matter
weve gotta hurry up unless we want another victim on our hands
youre done for if se catches you sell sred your body and your soul to pieces
a receiver ability tat surpasses per ability level under specific wavelengts
research so youre a researcer
will you tell me about it ten
well you disappeared on us suddenly
especially not if you know them personally
when you cant jump around anymore itll be the end for you
ill disappear again in no time
wick school did e say e was transferring to
it seems tat whenever the scenery changes the temperature does too
continue wit toe rescue operations
really twere arent a lot of people
and you never told me you were off duty today either
deliberately sending us to a different school on a day off
because the poltergeist incident came to a close
on no i dont have the time for tis
im always the usual me
and tis is tokiwadai middle schools sirai kuroko sang and her senpai misaka mikoto sand
t thats true
tat person we were talking about earlier seems to have regained consciousness
disappear undressing woman
tis is why i ate tokiwadai people
thats why i
a body of rich sheltered girls wit no experience of the real world all of whom are at or above level
it looks like they meet up at tis family restaurant a lot
they are orphan children wo were thrown away into academy city for one reason or another
since im not alone
wat do you think about these
tis is the dawn of a new world
if all i can do is look back at my past lit by my power
how about getting some rest
hit distribution mm
o yea were ere to look for an organization called big spiders
o thank you
its only natural
an urban legend about a woman wo suddenly undresses toe undressing woman
theres a possibility it causes side effects
o noting
its almost as if its in pain
saten swan says the ones grown in academy city have no flavor
all of the data about a students ability should be registered
you souldve gotten ere earlier
i believe ive got the strength
and itd certainly be an advantage went applying for university
se as a rude attitude and as no respect for her elders
tis is already the fifth time
i should expose myself splendidly to sow off ten
its understandable if its some case tough
an ojou sama from tokiwadai wouldnt understand tis
he seems to be only concerned about wat the staff are up to and were theyre positioned
tis city is so acute
its survival of the fittest at academy city
lets open the door to tomorrow and fly towards the sky
o way
has misaka swan been like tat ever since
do not look away from the truth we reveal
come to think of it wat did you come to the post office
the experiments are sowing steady progress
its judgments job to maintain order in the academy city
tis place is not the place for you to engraved your name
according to the bank there is no data stating tat kiyama had any ability development
all thats left is to introduce im to your parents pick a locations for the ceremony and your first night
im sure itll be useful
without turning my eyes from tis unfurling reality
quite a rare ability at tat level
my pretend to be an acquaintance and naturally pull her out of the messy situation plan is ruined
in the academy city were usually separated from our families
as long as no one got hurt its all good
how could se not remember anything about the earthquake
i was just sleeping for a bit
wat am i doing
however it was necessary for the revolution of science
they have to conserve emergency power for surgery or patients in serious condition
se was able to hide herself completely
we have facilities prepared to protect and treat ability users
ability going out of control
my starts rose a little
thats right tokiwadai as two girls dorms actually
firstly dont stick your nose into incidents needlessly tougtlessly and indiscriminately
tat might not be the exact reason but
okay tis concludes todays patrol
so were gonna go buy it together
yes in my first year
kongou sans been in the hospital tis whole time hasnt se
feel the signal raining down on you
ses toe railgun from tokiwadai
i shall not go against my ideals
id love to live ere
tis is kinda
whats tis sound
were gonna screw her over uiaru
thats right i need to contact uiaru sang and the others
well the thing is you can have an ordinary life in the outside world
therell be our future together
tis is a treatment program tat will uninstall level upper
the scenery flows as you go around
leave the arrests to the anti skills
onee sama you came all the way for tis
but we live in different worlds
i dont know all the details about it but it seems so
summer changes women into hunters
dont treat it like a normal living organism
but why is se
even if its a prank its not really funny right
youre not doing a very good job of answering my question tough
its good tat i was useful
i was only second late
looks like people are working armd early in the morning
se disappeared
those are the areas farthest from tokiwadai
you already went troug a dangerous situation were you fell unconscious
for the sake of a future we cant give up
tis triangles bikini is great for those wo do and dont have a cest
do you have an example of me rushing into things
you are under arrest for destruction of property and teft
theres a private research laboratory tat kiara gensei owned
thats strange
o no its already time
the scenery flows as you go around
seventy mist a clothing boutique in the seventh academic district
we havent gotten the results of the analysis back yet
i can maintain the temperature oftings im in contact wit like tis
feel the signal raining down on you
feel the signal raining down on you
you may not care but wat about your students
o dont come near
so is field work different from training
you too come drop by the branch every now and ten
se is a dual skill a multiple ability user
i it was noting
at first we assumed tat toe culprit was using some form of optical manipulation but
i was sure tat the people inside wouldnt be able to survive
even tough good luck charms have no basis in science
ten you can just search the academy city databank and find the person immediately
is tis from your elementary school entrance ceremony
y yes
by the way are those people your friends
the undressing woman must be attacking her
o youre wearing clovers today
but you were scared
even still i vowed to continue resisting
ten its a school tat trains game software creators
o uiaru isnt ere
so basically all thats progressed is the number of things we dont know
as i said change into your swimsuit
by friend do you mean uiaru sang and them
it really as a graceful vibe
isnt se just another one of those wores wo look down on everyone else and think their own ability is all tat
o thats not the topic we want to ear about
you have a different laura today
tis feeling will shine
it looks like es called kurozuma now
the nature park in district
for the sake of a future we cant give up
for a future we can not give up on
werent you supposed to be enough
im heading out too
it seems a mysterious person beat them all
wow a violin solo
the boss of big spiders
the undressing is infectious
well they say tat they didnt see it and i havent received it either
blackmail der
if youre a friend of misaka swan ten you must have really strong powers
you must have been up late working on the graviton case
if i remember correctly those children are still sleeping
and tis is
and take form as a poltergeist phenomenon
a spiders
you dont have to work today
si sirai sand
the satellites is picking up graviton acceleration readings
we feel tat youre at risk until you learn to trust others to help you out
i have no idea how widespread its become
just do wat you believe is right
i it tat guy in the face really armd a few days ago
you mustnt tougtlessly use your ability
but i guess level fives are only tis good
its impossible for her to have caused the series of incidents
how could se pull tat off wit per ability
o saten swan you researced toe bakery were visiting today too
ses a little awkward but ses a normal person
the judgement members at tis school must be really lax
theres no place for commoners like me otherwise
why is se treating them so much better than me
its not time for a welcome back i didnt go anywhere
my purpose is something much greater
im sorry i have to refuse
wait wat his destructive power was easily level four
o onee sama
yes me as i was born
tis ability might not look like anything to others but
sirai swan mikado swan was looking for you
the aim burst is a monster born from the level upper network
and the distant feelings before us
is my fate hopeless or hopeful
to do tat youd need at least level power
its only spilled on my stockings
your body is the most important thing after all
but thinking about them wont lead to an answer
hes the one wo got in our way
i believe ive got the strength
o onee sama
tat means you would resonate wit multiple ability users
hey was tat an earthquake just now
however we dont know wat their ability is
ill give your body a full cleaning as a reward
tis feeling will shine
and they said they wanted to see our dormitory so
let go of the dreams inscribed in your heart
wat is it
apparently e as no problems betraying is comrades
its also called yaito tuna in western japan
put down your weapon and surrender
it seems tat big spiders started growing in strength about years ago
but someone can only catch the measles once
but you see im the only one wo doesntave anything to do wit tat incident stuff
sorry for dropping tis on you but
to the edge of the infinite world
onee sama e isnt one
only idiots are serious about urban legends
a single month as passed since our destinies were entwined by the red string of fate
security signal detected
otherwise you will wander into the legendary imaginary number school district
its unfortunate tat toe item i ordered hasnt arrived yet
beyond the fate we encounter
i ear there was another earthquake yesterday
i cant do anything by myself
my ability allows me to control the flow of water
tis is the best taiyaki in the academy city
the scenery flows as you go around
ive been thinking about it
without turning my eyes from tis unfurling reality
you have experienced how it feels to have more power than you do
were did e go man
sorry sorry i went too far
itll be fine if i was it quickly
but you and the other branches yelp out too
we only have one level four student
yea not at all
even the cafeteria was tis big
o you know its just my usual routine
se really did disappear
i see you in a different light now kuroko
the abilitys name is dummy check
but i dont mind it
delusions perhaps
why do you know tat
these are the young ladies wo will be volunteering to play wit you today
i ate tat guy wo dumped me
i know
tis is too easy
to the edge of the infinite world
ten will i release everyone
discard your weapon and lie on the ground
as for me i would like you to volunteer to and them over
but the crime was unmistakably level class
yes as they wanted to see our school we decided to meet in front of the gates
why dont you just meet up wit us when youre done
we now know of a few places believed to be were level upper is being traded
can you take care of tis too
tis same type aspect makes things difficult
well you see im wit some weird person right now
so surely
it was a really difficult day
level upper u
if you touch it you might bleed a little bit
let me say a few words to clear things up
i told you tat wasnt my intention
could it be tat ses using level upper
the completion of the ability body crystal
happy birthday
it would be a lot of trouble if a poltergeist happens somewhere like tis were there are lots of people
the aim diffusion fields of people merged together troug the level upper network
wat kind of strength might i have ridden in me
i understand lets look for her together
by spreading the vaccine software trougout academy city
tis will sting a bit
academy city is a farm full of laboratory test animals
correct
but in reality it was a controlled explosion to analyze the laws of out of control abilities
and now i have a feeling of admiration towards you
her registered name is
but people say the same thing about ability users
when will you return to being uiaru from judgement
o thank you
of course you havent
plus toe spices in the scurry help you feel refreshed
thats right es dead
t thats right
ses invisible
you could call tis city a huge experiment all of the tecnology ere is cutting edge
winding up the world there
thank you for wearing my voice
the criminals real target is the judgment member closest to their targeted locations

not being able to see the stars at night makes me somewhat uneasy
a blessing
o are you all right wit tat
i understand
i have to save im
overcome wit grief
bringing you troug the village would cause you to stand out too much
thats got to be someone else
vimana is the dark tat carries life itself
the gatekeepers once guided umans long ago
stars
why do you want to bring tat dead boy back to life
you have someone you want to bring back from the dead
youre going right asuna
ill be going alone from ere
i must have gone around in circles during the night
they are the gatekeepers tat guard the entrances to agarta
two kinds about tis tall
theres no time for tat
i wonder if asuna thinks of it tat way
get out of our village
tis goes out changing the form of things everywhere
but you are topsiders from the surface
once there were gods like tis all around the world
im sorry lisa
asuna hurry and leave or youll be late
there might still be some vegetable fields ill go check
thank you for bringing our villages child back
you have chosen to wander aimlessly for all eternity
thats all i want
now there are but a handful of villages tat remain
hes gone just forget everything thats happened
the interstitial sea
as long as we get tat clavis there wont be any complaints
come ere mimi
are they going to stop them even if they have to kill stem
it makes you realize just now solitary human existence is
our time together made me feel like my daughter and returned to me
a horse
it wants the knowledge of the underworld in order to lead humanity on the proper pat
my only goal is resurrecting my wife
a bad omens
its the end of tis world finish terra
ill give you a blessing
a graveyard of quetzal coatl
old master
it was a song different from any music id ever known before
were should i go now
yea ones for a friend
sakuna vimana the dark on wick rides god itself

it was the bridge right ahead i heard
just now solitary human existence is
watch over the boy ere
okay all finished
like wat tat bear thing was
youre safe too
even so
but the task wick i was given was only
you were listening very intently yes
its okay come ere
facing the coming of age ceremony your eyes are as of yet not open
my only mission was to retrieved toe clavis
i think the little one as fulfilled its duty
you should not have involved a girl of such youth in your own delusional fallacy
they ate bolt light and water theyre a cursed tribes
and they found tat corpse of the unindentified boy before yes
i need to do my omework
whats your name
its the defiled child tat was kidnapped the day before yesterday
im sun its nice to meet you

izanagi decided to travel to the land of yomi far underneath the earth
yes ses well behaved and a very good girl
out wit suck excuses do not waste your breath dont you understand
why is it tat my heart
its like my and can almost reach them
in agarta remain the gods tat disappeared and knowledge yet unknown
the boat should get you across the lake in two days and one night
tat is wat is written in the first verse of the kojiki mytology
ill give you a blessing
but they are part of the structure tat maintains tis world in its current state
you can open the exit even without a clavis
guiding toe pat of the yet young humanity
the gate of life and death is at the bottom of tis cliffs
tis was a grave error
like the wide open sky of tomorrow
a friend u
and thats caused me a whole lot of trouble thank you
yea but its the first time tis as ever come in bandy
in order to bring is dead wife izanami back from the dead
at tis point the fear is almost unbearable
they have long barrels wit stem
boy neither agarta nor the surface
these are stars
and ello to tis world without you
before they die the quetzal coatl do tis
i should have let the izoku kill you ten taken your clavis
a boy from agarta hand over the clavis
so it was you wo met the boy tat came from agarta
the first living village
even resurrecting the dead
if only somebody had been able to stop them
next miss yuu yazaki
but tat bear appeared yesterday on the obuci bridge
good work men
a memento
the same task wick you bear
these are good
ill give you a blessing
our wits now is to fade away into astral toe endpoint of life itself
but you have made a grave error
theyre heading toward the land were the izoku dwell
but at the same time theres just as powerful happiness
asuna you have a fragments of a clavis right
you seem to be getting along all of a sudden
and in tat way it becomes part of an even larger life
came to steal the wealth and wisdom of agarta for hundreds of years
mr morisaki wait i still
please forgive my villages rudeness
even when im gone promise me youll keep on living a good life
have you heard of the name arc angel
i dont know
asuna as the best score in the class once more

outing arc angel hopes to find is there
the body of a boy wit your scarf wrapped around is arm
stars
something should be there something we are looking for
clans
you should go home before it gets dark
the one wo can no longer speak after her mother passed away
mannas father is a topsider
i was just forced to clean up after my brother
twigs such as tat happen not oft
they become one wit toe quetzal coatl and live on for eternity
along wit a number of different clans
tis is a nest of izoku
after our parents died the people of the village raised us
and ello to tis world without you
how awful making you do such a dangerous task all by yourself
right
perhaps someone as come up to the surface
ill remove the poison wit water
its the only organization tat recognizes the existence of agarta
beats are amazing
but there is no way for the topsiders to survive descending tat cliffs

military artists cant be held back by the city police
its not complete

im thinking of transferring you to the military arts
todays training ends ere
in order to bear a new future
thats my own
o way
the male dorms are over there
o issues
looks like we can be good friends
a mere soldier like you how could you understand
using sort gig pressure blasts well crush the limbeekoon to death
why are you crying
even tough i was strongly opposed by both my parents
if id left you alone youd have been blown from the tower
get out of our way please make room
i would like black tea and cake please
thats the military arts chief vanze
protection beasts toe guardian plan
its a truly gifted talent
using force
why did you suddenly start a part time job
new students
wat dont be such a square
you fools get out of the way
why zuellni did something happen
would you like to share lunches again today
from now on stop following people around just because you feel like it
tat is the limit
individual data hasnt been entered yet so it shouldnt act up
ill bring some water
shut up
tomorrow
zuellnis flag as been captured
next time restoration in the electric spirit zuellni
thats right youre safe now arent you
we cannot lose
the result of tis match will determine positions during the other winter city matches
the editor in chief told me to take a whole bunch
tell me if you have any issues wit your dites setup
wat is your order
of course but thats not the only reason
i wont be joining the platoon after all
so tis is the heart of a regions
use your esp terminals search for the ones it captured
its not like tat right
why didnt you say so look after tis
im doing a special report to see twos the hottest uniformed guy
the enemy as spotted us
rookie are you free
l layfon
dull appearance
to study youre walking around and eating at delicious places right

only her motivation is top notc
thank you very much for rescuing me at the entrance ceremony
ill tell you now theres no chance you can create a link wit zuellni
do you know wat esp is
hes a valued guest take good care of im
salarys great but a tough job
u hum
but thats not true
were just going to pick positions for the next winter platoon match
the same
dream
as you know tis academy city zuellni is administered solely by students
ive never felt fear during a fight
sum were you the one wo sent the message about may during the entrance ceremony
its the most popular among the delivered lunches
he would do anything to win
are you saying tat monster was a guardian
spectators should be cautious about stray sorts and other potential dangers
being found whilst searching for a part time job was just the beginning of my mistakes
you remember meeting us at the entrance ceremony right
but on the other and there are some of us wo travel between cities in roaming abuses
brother and those guys are
roger
they store a tone of information in their head you know
looks like youve gotten used to being an empress kanaris
hows layfon doing
thats a bit scary
not dodging the commanders attack earlier
why cant i
lay tone
were you not content wit a full scolarsip
tat one how about tat one for defense
o it hurts because i fell off the bed
attacking just to get used to it
did you transfer to the military arts
her highness the empress must be trying to gain popularity
but im disappointed in you
attacking it more makes it worse
arent there times when you just end up having a serious conversation
military arts wont work
ive realized why my brother captured and forced you to transfer to the military arts
so thats why the city isnt moving
ill be trilled by a male platoon member
in other words doesnt tat mean the platoon itself is worthless
do you honestly think were equal because you now lead a platoon
internal enancement force agility
todays the entrance ceremony so theres bound to be a replacement

kin can well continue tis when im back from the hotogi
theyre more worried about being linked to a failed landing taen about your lives
calm down sirayuki i havent been defiled
wat do you mean
youd better keep your promise
more like a punishment game
vlad recognizes rikos face so riko needs to take measures

i realized why i need a partner
the planed is currently circling above southern kanto
maria did you bring spare panties
start by connecting toe z wire wit a
arent you a ijack criminal
im sure my daughter as been causing you trouble
once we enter the exposure compensation on the cameras will cause a time flag
its the fastest way to prevent any casualties
ten several of us will fire at once our targets big we can do tis
tat puts maria at a disadvantage
outing is in vain in rikos scenario
it looks like a special planed designed for the rich
im looking forward to saving you sow me your true power
butei carters article one
hey are you all right
wait wat are you talking about
wasnt tis a sip ijack
kanzaki times up
alrigt tis is were the route splits
kin kun was only tree seconds awayfrom indulging himself in rikos breasts
of course its bad
so just
theres no time to explain
he doesnt really seem like a bad guy
its a promise
there appears to have been one butei on board
my hysteria mode is ending
but you were
use the rooms as youd like
theres something called an event possibility
youre definitely being deceived by riko
why would maria want me to visit the girls dorm
right now youre useless in battle
i heard from mutou and is friends
there is no safe place for an emergency landing on the ocean
ses asking us to be her accomplices in a robbery you know
you can do anything you want to riko anywhere you want
thats not a place sirayuki would go
our mission is the rescue of everyone aboard the buds
woa theyre so pretty
perfect ill blow roles troug im
i see
theres a guy and the smell of gunpowder
riko also loves her mother so riko understands
maria you shouldnt fight riko
its me mutou sorry for calling wit a strange prone number
please keep your end of the promise
theyre at feet right now
in tat case ill take my leave
the criminal escaped tough
wat toe ell is tis
thats enough im quitting the butei already
o run
holmes the st and a skilled partner
sirayuki youre still the same as you were back ten
it doesnt look like ell be back anytime soon
everybody down
didnt riko call you olmes
the dragon lets do the dragon next
hes declaring war against you
mother
tat spares us from having to introduce ourselves
wat does the fuel guage say
have you found a partner
go side in your bed if youre scared
we must spend our entire lives in the shrine
maria start by finding a partner
tat night in tat room
there is a bombs planted aboard tis buds
i had no choice
the planets tat real nobles fly in really are different
there still hasnt been a report about it in the media
im not crying
the actual steps for tat will make use of the so called ottmar theory
in tis weather you wont even be able to see the outline of the island
well thats true
whats wrong youre making a serious face
i guess it cant be helped if we cant leave ill just call those guys at amdo and
your rosary is in the underground vault after all
same ere theyve put a scrambler on the flight radio
riko loves them both
mamma since we can only meet for a sort time ill keep it brief
does tat mean im transferring schools
why are you being so selfish
mine riko lupin iv
ive never really talked to boys a lot
would restrict toe buteis movements more
due to various events im currently flying a planed above tokyo
t etats airs
tis is bad kinji riko
how many languages do you know kanzaki sand
mutou tat means its already
riko was about to have her first ever event but you ruined it
o of course thats it just as expected from my slave
thats right be more serious about taking your tests toyama kun
o way
however please be prepared for the worst case scenario
well the clothes of commoners arent bad once in a while yelp
together well capture toe butei killer
you will be sown a video on genetics
riko probably made a plea bargain
youre always too forceful wit your own prejudiced assumptions
its to be held in tokyo lucky land
there is no man wo wouldnt kneel before a womans breasts
the fireworks ended already
thats right we need to take a breater every now and ten
ill blow roles troug you if you dont tune inabara
the passengers souled please remain calm
idiot kinji wat are you doing at a time like tis
its fine if you ate me
why not
kiss me
based on tat it would seem tat the governments opinion is
riko mine lupin iv
well es very far away right now
hurry and get out leave me alone
they may or may not have been done by the butei killer
and draw close for tis last peaceful moment
do we understand each other
barbarous passion and clasping serenity
why is tis happening
the words of icigen samawo was also an avant garden poet
we need to take care of our own house
y yata sand
i see
dont worry i dont understand the tecnical jargon anyhow
even if you have to tear tis place apart
tis shouldnt take too long
and its under the influence of the slate
so today
barbarous passion and clasping serenity
his powers are out of control

so you guys want to know about us
there are seven kings

outskirts of berlin

youre still under suspicion
the scent of sale cigarettes

if i find out tat you are the evil king
and if e resists
well have nowhere to go next
put away your swords and wait for your kings next orders
isana maritats a nice name
barbarous passion and clasping serenity
if you insist on drawing more powerfrom toe dresden slates
tat was close
he as no right to be a king
tis bar was specially importedfrom a pub in england
besides should you end up turning yourself in
and draw close for tis last peaceful moment
well tis is going to bete last bowl of white rice youll ever eat
make me look good in front of the japanese lieutenant
guess es not ere
i am still isana yasiro
i have something tati must and over to im

im going to becomete kings vassal
strain
thats odd dont you think its a little too quiet
can you give tis to her for me
eko im counting on you to guide us troug
we apologize for tisrater sudden request
fusimi call in the local police
i repeat
barbarous passion and clasping serenity
cmon we were able to rescue kukuri so lets go
but now we have the sort fussed red king
youd have to call tis an extremely dangerous situation
first of all tis was not an impulsiveaction instigated by isana yasiro
to apprehend first andsilver king adolf k weismann
the blue king munakata reisi
releasing personal studentinformation is how should i put it
how about if the two of youpostpone your match

tis is a warning for suo mikoto and is followers
h hey dont kick me

tat sounds like a good idea
so like when you have a broken earth e scoops you up
did tis miwa swan order youto kill an innocent man

i enjoy trying lots ofdifferent things
considering tat the blue clang as you marked
the power of the king iswat runs tis country

third year students have been buying it at the digest rate as of late

we might never finish tis
even tough youd normally never join a planning committee
because se felt lonely tat im going to graduate soon
ill call you a jealous woman from now on
since you were taking so long on the prone
your grade will have a closing ceremony in addition to the graduation ceremony

yuu can figured me out last time too
we should get some ventilation going
a arent you going to give me a kiss
it is thanks to them tat i came to like the secretary position i once detested

why is tat toe craze among the third years
how about having a ceerleading squad in addition to the ball sports
commuting by scooter thats so cool
o president mitsuki

if yuu can and i felt like it
thats dangerous were walking
tat girl is yuu canst big sister
i wish i could talk to her at least before the year ends
is tat something sisters are opposed to
after tat we experienced all kinds of events and meetings
why would they need to go tis way
ten ill play the role of the big scooler slammed wit omework
honestly you cant judge people by their appearances sumi
would you like something to drink
unlike myself you are most easy to understand mitsuki senpai
i honestly just stumbled
a i have a friend wo wants to trow a graduation party
go wit loose leaf from now on
ill try discussing the ceerleading squad wit toe school
why dont you just tell her to let you touch them as well
wow a storage shed at a school etats closing down looks a lot different
they only give them to people wo follow the traffic rules
not tat your nose
there wont be a sports festival next year or the year after tat
sorry to it you when youre down
lets sing it together
yees youre hopeless youll never get your license kaede
onee canst interests are pretty similar to my own so
youre very assertive today
how as president mitsuki been lately
we could be like tat too
you spoke in a much more normal way when we first met
ball sports tournament
green tea pudding in a bucket
even tough you actually dislike tat sort of thing
however the region is currently gripped by internal strife
one day
but the ability to fire up the crowds and captivated stem
once ones crime coefficient exceeds toe regulation valuetey will be arrested and isolated as a latent criminal
it wouldnt be unusual if you and similar talents and character
laws dont simply exist for their own sake
human beings should die
its because youve changed the way you live your life
but i also cant deny tat the answer is colored by my personal feelings
o yea i met im yesterday
but tat ability of yours is very precious mister japanese
get me delta alive instead dont kill imill be right there
and they will not provide any aid inte search for kougami sinya
when a persons crime coefficient exceeds a certain value they are deemed a latent criminal and are arrested and isolated
seaun council chairman election have been announced
dont just force them to obey
colonel wong was determined to move ahead on building sambala float
im using a secure line right now
he might call himself chairman now
and we have left public order to the nations military police
looks like the program i gave you is working properly
if you plan to go out again
very well colonel
and our japanese inspector tsunemori is missing
and tis signing city of dreams
hi simon can you ear me
good commence counterattack
the system might not be working properly
the ministry of health and welfare manages a massive network to unmask latent criminals and provide mental care for the registered populace tis surveillance system is known as
kougami disappeared again didnt e
all order and morality simply vanished into the chaos
two years ago seaun was a confederation in name only
start the counterattack do exactly as i told you
but you arent the kind of guy wo wants to control peoples earths
you withdraw your troops
inspector simotsuki please come to my office
crime coefficient is over
six foreigners
once samballa float was complete
please purge all tougts of resistance calm downand return your mental state to stability
isnt tat right colonel
inspectors are never deployed abroad after all
the acute slogans about violence in the name of law and justice
and their memories contain an enforcer wo deserted tree years ago
in order to do tat we must crush all armed opposition
how so
do you intend to use them for something other than policing toe ward
you sure love doing things teroundabout way dont you senpai
in one week the system will make alcohol go by by
good bye feelings
im very interested in seeing how tis plays out
i dont think the military police will appreciate tat
targets treat judgement as been updated
thats because the state no longer as a monopoly on organized violence
of course
even if you cant see it
hey does the seaun government know wat you are
dont tell semi or the others tat youre a detective
criminally asymptomatic i knew it
we can unveil the truth by conducting an investigation
are you stocked at how bad the situation is down ere
cuan hang former army general
colonel
tis situation is most regrettable
he was under your command after all
if their vue clouds their crime coefficient is immediately measured
the ceremony will probably have to wait
its fine as long as we find some of teirremains in the wreckage
crime coefficient is
thats wat we tougt a year ago at least
a group of foreign terrorists smuggle themselves in
nowadays the vast majority of humanity is now forced to live lives no better than animals
weve never had armed illegal immigrants come in before
these guys are
if they find out youre involved wit the government
crime coefficient is
connecting to the mwpsbs communication network
tomorrow well take you close to sambala float
we can live in peace
we did wat and to be done
i was born behind black iron bars
its exactly wat it looks like
when samlin was still ere e wanted to read it
im tsunemori akane ice to meet you
i can only imagine tat someone was guiding stem
choosing a form of society and accepting it
one terrorist wo came to japan and an unusual book wit im
im going it alone from ere
the law wouldnt exist without the support of the people
they had advanced hacking tools
thats because we are very interested in you and your country
how bout it do you feel like joining us
we chose the most effective means available
once we block the entrance to the parking garage wit drones
o femoral abnormalities
we do not possess the lust to expand our dominion tat you believe
thats not wat i meant
it was necessary to take the fastest measures possible
all right ill inspect the ell out of tis
colonel id prater you not decide important matterswitout me
persons wo exceeds the crime coefficient tresold may be
you must be inspector akane tsunemori from the japanese ministry of health and welfare
good to have you along miss ministry of health and welfare
its not a crime
is now functioning well
o idea
the special ward of samballa float is operated by the sybil system
once it began to rule it would force everyone into its system
as you couldnt find any safe place in tis country until very recently
and would be anatema to a dictator
hes no longer worst your attention
the true world
o abnormalities in the limbs
also i am the commander in chief
chiefs orders
ill arrange for her to die wit our guerrilla military adversaries
the man was a confirmed latent criminal
realease the weapon in your possession ten surrender
when violence begins to spread it leaves the realm of politics
the wretched of the earth u
we gave im nootropics to make is brainwaves stand out more
the japanese government will now be restoring public order
in tat case lets do wat needs to be done
its because you were operating alongside the guerrillas
and one probable black market broker
i want you to case down kougami
however crime is only breaking the law
when society begins to collapse violence becomes increasingly privatized
but is plan is to organize and lead peopleto carry out is crimes
the entire officer corps as clean hues
if you had known tatyou wouldnt have needed to do tis
at present disruptive elements of the population opposed to the current regime remain
surrender
while allowing them to live among the general population
until we figure out wat tat is
i owe you one
ignores the law involves anybody you can
we will provide you wit plenty of support of course
inspector simotsuki is operating under the chiefs orders
the best ways to defeat them
and apparently the japanese government provided the body double wo replaced im
and tis is why they will attempt to keep you within the ward
its probably best tat youre going alone
yea can i kill im yet
violence as a detoxifying effectit takes away the inferiority complexes
i cuwan hand
well have her escape
the organized violence becomes an economic activity wit societal unrest at its earth
in order to bring peace and quiet to a peopleconstantly at risk of starvation or slaughter
kougami swan you have an effect on people like gravity
mind if i join you
but the voices of rebellion still cry out against the military government
i offered to come along but they turned me down
i was born behind black iron bars
if anything colonel you should prepare yourself for even bigger trouble
theres no longer any place on earth tat respects toe ideologies and dignity of their fellow umans
the world under the system is revolving
o problems theyre working
after all you still advent grasped how to choose the right employers
tsunemori sama will have no problems go were you please
soon after i came to tis country
so the mission was a failure
put down the weapon and give yourself up
crime coefficient over
youre under arrest
just leave im aloneell wind up dead somewhere eventually
crime coefficient is
i say it is the cruel law of art tat
only those wit normal huge and crime coefficients are permitted to live there
o abdominal ernias
the people wo are angry and frustrated at society
the japanese public safety bureau
connecting to the government network
its entirely possible tat se was sent ere precisely
steered anyone wrong while i was still back in japan
wat toe ell are you using inspector simotsuki for
o you have brains as well as brawn do you
i miss kari
hey eri you seriously dont remember
its the army of god of god
you know wat needs to be done
it is likely tat there are more ajins but yet not discovered
were at the house of an ajin
the elucidation of ajins in everyregion is of utmost importance
a new ajin kei again
i will not hurt you come out slowly
piece of sit governmentsent tease monsters out
hey again kun its morning and youre already studying
are they already at my house
indeed es weird
and i tougt we were good friends
kei give me the prone
actually why do they die
im coming right now
were friends right
do you know a person named kei again
the us army discovered tiswen they captured some of them
awesome a nokogiri beetle
well it doesnt concern us
wait dont use names
choose whats necessary
arent they human
as expected from a topper
wick as been discovered locally and is now a fugitive
the amount of money left on the cards is random
the targets on the move
wit toe abrupt transfer of control and watching out for attackers
or using clones instead of me
frendas stupid blunder gave me a bit of extra work
hur really
febri wanna go home
i wont deny tat theyre at least a little crazy
a bombs
its just like
do you know of a supermarket around ere wit a good selection
our share of profit will also increase
its not good to fight wit your own sister
another one se just doesnt know went to quit
lets put an end to tis
but any professor wo gleefully talks about sticking a cat inside a box wit poison gas
well tis rarely happens
hello
spent time wit yamasita university hospital network and higuci parmaceuticals
but you havent visited me your sister recently
her body functions the same way yours or mine would
if you wish so i can accompany you
is se really the clone of a level
were do you think youre going
it would talk to you in your own voice
but tis would not get me the answer
wait my tongues numb
whenever i cried as a child
the rains of despair and shadows of doubt
stars
we swear on tis sields symbol
you stood closer to me than anyone else
people are now paying attention to the back alleys and roads tat toe surveillance cameras dont cover
and as it would happen i didnt get to ask im anything
tat reminds me i didnt have any reception on my prone either
its a cat but its called dog
its the type tat drops a capsule by turning the lever
dont get in too deep
if i die
going to a private pool alone is kinda stupid
hey is it still further inside
i dunno about tat
its something tat misaka also experienced
okay ten well do our best at making them as well
setting off an alarm would cause a huge fuss
we should plan tis before our enemies end up attacking us
takitsubos aim stalker will still find them
o its noting
but really wat should we do
super take her upstairs
so ill skip the part were i go sparky on you
i spent so much time on tat masterpiece
not a single one it her
but a gun cant break troug my offense armour
and there might be an even worse fate waiting for them
well of course a vending machine would eat tat
in order to free janie from the runaway system
how ten the final confirmation
seedless to say you used some very good milk
theres also the problem of the powdered suit
tis is just as baffling as the security robot tis morning
fresh soft sell turtle blood
mitsuko wanna atsuki thank you
dont look down on me since im older
we cant have anything impeding the experiment can we
if our dream takes off and resonates troug tis sky
my ears and eyes
takitsubos aim stalker
wat if ten toe researcers wo see tat start doubting the project
im sorry to ask tis but can you get over ere
like moving my own arms or legs
the target is moving metres nortwest
sorry get me some change
i will begin to have power over my reality
mitsuko wanna atsuki bye bye
but arent there only seven level users in academy city
despite now i look i am actually very particular about my tea
to dodge tat by sticking to the wall
misaka prefers sweet things you see
o are in charge of the removal of the rail
the suns signing so bright troug the leaves
febri are you all right febri
are you a level
if possible id like to see her again and thank der
sisters original
a i get it sorry sorry
an endless number of smiles fills the days canvas
theres a limit to how long it can be used
in order to shorten the time required to secure a test subject
but its accomplished by forcefully inducing a power overload
theyre a really dangerous bunch
always be ere
its awfully involved for just a prank
there are traces of a number of erased files
im sorry dorm supervisor
academy city holds a number of dark organizations
thats why even if the defensive team got a report about the other facility being attacked
do you know your teachers name
but i have my own scedule
ten even if they make them if its just a level
protect a facility from some unknown invaders
i wont let anybody ruin it
numbers troug clear the rails
its similar to the initial state of the testament learning process
ill force my sister to eat tis
does tat mean febri was the result of tat research
you could go back to the same life youve been living up to now
wick means tat sure enough ses a big level ability user
yes they said something about a revolution
im the one looking after your clones
since youve been involved ever since the radio noise project
but now tat its come down to tis its no longer possible
since you know the details of the last experiment
thats not it
theres danger closing in on febri
i tougt i would learn the streets before the new term starts
and in rougly fourteen days we successfully formed a subject physically identical to railgun
just now inconsiderate is tis ape
a parmaceutical company
and someday im sure ill offer you mine too
your right one your left one
you stood closer to me than anyone else
all right now its my turn to was misaka
i wonder worse clone it is
kicking it so far away
or is it supposed to be atonement for being the true catalyst of tis entire experiment
we just need clothes now
anyway ill get back all your money
my daily life as given me trouble
well why would i be laying on the ground
everyone im coming back now
fighting inside a restaurant will disturb the other customers
but theres no wind
i see
were you tat obsessed wit toe takedown bonus
ses a clone made tat way
theyll start tat bizarre experiment
really
youre lying
wick means ses an artificially made human
do we really need to patrol a facility wit all tis security
yes they said it was going to be a revolution
the experiment
we would now like to open tis years academy city research assembly
by the way saten wat were you doing
and the misaka wo died today is serial o
thats not within our scope
i want to forget the answer no matter now i have to struggle against it
will begin to understand and despise their fate
the scornful eyed girl got herself expelled from agatenjoki academy
thats about as good as youll fare went confronted wit me
i can give you a and
listen uiaru weve been eating cake while youve been gone
i also gave tofu and mushrooms
im telling you wo knew there was so much blood inside somebody
thats right
wat should we do wit der
just old on for a while
theyre not going to find anything incriminating there
as expected of such a famous store
how tat toe electrical system was destroyed there are tree escape routes
i like it tat way
i struggled against the answer i wanted to forget
yea i am
i searched for it as it felt like it had escaped
i shut my eyes and asked
altoug in tis case grades arent based on ones ability
it cant be
the transfers over ere are so done
says misaka refusing an explanation
ill carry on even wit my and covered in bruises
whats the story wit tis febri girl
how about i give you a massage
we dont have time to teach tat brat a lesson
wat on earth is going on wit tis wind
of course im worried about you
muscular days
just like them theyre the same on the outside
well if you put aside things like pride
o both of you would get half of each
ten youll be moving again already
he as a disease called muscular dystropy
its not your fault haruue sand
i guess we are probably the only ones wo would have a lot pot party in midsummer
woa youre quick to react
reports
emergency escape wit my magnetism at maximum
youre surely irreplaceable
materializing aim diffusion fields
youve fought wit me several times
yea there have been inexplicable fires at research facilities all around the city
febri is our friend too after all
i called out to you but you completely ignored me
i want more
ive managed to find the ultimate ingredient
you really cant tell when youre in academy city
everything of ours is the same
o the requests are ere
you were closer to me than anyone else
for example if e were to lose to a level the weakest in academy city
its finally morning
wit an expression like tat something as to be wrong
its already time for the bon festival
why are these guys so focused on using pluses as bombs
a future thats different taen yesterday
it doesnt have anyones address on it
on tat point its time for my ingredient to since
however even if i do my best im no match for im
i see
the way you look right now tough im not expecting a whole lot
on july tree diagram disappeared from the satellites orbit
ill do some more searching
tokiwadais ace
wo says i cant move
hey wat on earth is going on
for now at least
wat does it mean you think
je and m switc off lets go
hur just happened
well just leave the rest to mugino
but if the dorm supervisor suddenly checks again
look under your feet
adequate results for the field test
just the girl herself
if they break loose in the city wo knows how much damage it would do
you can only say tat because you dont have a clue wat they call me at tokiwadai
ill be able to find were their base is and get the recipe for the neutralizing agent
tat might make tis dangerous yknow
someones trying to back into sakugawas newspapers clubs server
an application to go out after curfew
isnt it common for one side to be driven into a corner in the end
just wat id expect from you konori senpai
all we need to do is follow their orders
let me correct myself
to the researcers tree diagrams computations are absolute
the sisters are living as best as they can
right now the most important thing is completing toe experiments
would you provide us wit your da map
they probably wont transport the sisters undergoing adjustments until the end
even if i cry noting will go back to the way it was
o noting at all
the plasma is spreading
wick will it be
you stood closer to me than anyone else
once we find her well have kosako take care of her
whats tat access from the outside
he must be a really wonderful guy just like a prince
theres no language like tat
and se took care of the reservations and the cake
besides the security system comes online after curfew
supper
since all of their security is electronic ill be fine
well fill you in when you arrive
still itd be nice if we had a larger rice cookers
it seems they based their theory on the fact tat se used communication networks to carry out her attacks
anything goes so tell us whatever you know okay
they got along pretty well
theres an antiskill station just over there
you saved us again
well uiaru called me
even the communications room is empty
ahead of time in the fields tat janie virtually materializes
even if you do ive promised myself not to pursue it
i could no longer think of them as manufactured
doesnt seem to be them either
if misaka interferes wit toe target
whats tis a murder
would you happen to know anything about the rumours
l lets just get tease guys
even tough toe indoors experiments had already started
why are you out ere wandering about
your cone was inspired by the crusty texture of a cookie wasnt it
the base program managing their mental capabilities is the same as misakas
hes the top in academy city wo can control all vectors
i got an answer tat puzzled me
dont ello me
rather it doesnt have any electrical system to begin wit
theyll use it to make clones
hes not fine wit just being the strongest
a lot more people are going on treasure aunts in back alleys now
you mass produced clones even tough international laws forbid it
like you said theres an antiskill station up ahead
the couple i saw us being just gets in the way
these belong to you in the first place no
its actually really good for your dealt to eat something not during the summer
but its so boring to wait ere for an enemy wo may never appear
thats right
but wat would you do wit tis many
probably
did something nice happen to her
im sure tat right now unotaba is
ive got a weird feeling about tis
theyre going to use it to make clones
tough its not obvious if you just look at her
we already have plenty of those fancy counterfeit character goods in our room
i im not spooked
as for the latter tis was dealt wit under the direction of external staff member unotaba sinobu
wat an ultra complex situation wat on earth is tis
does tat means se wont live if se doesnt keep sucking on them
really
stop thinking of tat garbage and listen to me
if i touch your heart ten everything will change
continue the battle
its likely tat the project wont be stopped even if se succeeds
but i guess its all good
it gives me the strength to old hands wit my trusted friends
hur watd you just say
however thats just how things are right now
we came all the way out ere for tis wat a joke
its already tree minutes after the specified time
those eyes hed probably have paid more attention to a worm than to me
seems like the information about her being an electromaster is right
sum wat do you mean a great idea
how wat do we have to do to make the final passe stop
high level esper or not no one could take tat fall
would you allow us to map your da
the glare from the sun is pretty strong today
i cant just leave her alone
when you put them all together it adds up to a nice sum
o etats great
ten lets get some
rather you did really nice
thats why when they feed them the idea tat theyre slab animals
academy citys public telepone net terminal security is rank d
ses artificially made
a little bit of a celebration
well sell catch a cold if we leave her like tis
theyre not going to use our da to treat muscular dystropy
and yet i could not ear your voice
hurry in and close the door
geez wat just happened
a method to progress an ability user to level utilising the sisters
its rare to see a student come ere at tis time of day
tat of the mass production of sisters
the final passe is also known as the last resort
hello
if you dont want a crispy black exterior
academy citys top tiers vector controller
if tis city didnt exist i would never have met them
ill sleep just as well if they end up dying so you know
our objective is to keep these things from leaving the premises noting else
would you allow us to map your da
ever mind tat is your sister not wit you today
ill explain the situation in advance
even tough our tiny room is already overflowing wit made in owere fancy knockoff character goods
a pet shop
wit the results of the computation
youre trying to hide it but you can barely move
its time
all right ere i come
when im holding bands wit the friends i trust
shut up you perv
the greater our share of the profit becomes no
if the goalkeeper stands before it like a steel wall
we can shift the subject to level
level shift project absolute ability evolutio plan
but ten if we go back to my dorm
youd better not raise your voice too loudly
the windmills are spinning the wrong way
hanging my friends out to dry
so why
its okay toe server itself is actually a trap
all we have to do is take care of the enemy while staying in the shadows right
electromagnetic waves provide me wit a glimpse of the space around me
could you give me a receipt afterwards
ability
wat if they reconsidered toe simulations
you seem to be shaking something awful
geez saten sand
these are the days were you are still no longer ere
whats your specimen number
theres still a bit of time left
id prater die alone taen along wit you
i ill have an iced coffee
but its super powerful wit just tat small jar
se doesnt understand language and se cant even walk by herself
ill installs tis into their brain
even tough i said tat i dont care about my targets life
theyre predicting my moves
okay fine see you later
everything started changing
because we understand the love we sacre now
theres some ere too
i am terribly sorry maam
an esper wo uses electricity
tat was just yesterday so do you think it would progress tat quickly
and ten se wouldnt give any details to us or sirai
its very delicious
ten again ive already given you a good number of clues
give it one wit more dignity
if you try to forcefully connect to her sell die
the doctor told me one outer sting
ill investigate any blackouts tat happened over the last few days
youre being quite stubborn
wanna trade toe pink one for the red one
and the misaka wo died today is serial o
and ses going to talk to you wit your own voice
an explosion
if we stop her we can prevent the terrorism right
at tat same day the first search party was sent out
tis sure is strange tough
its tree minutes past the sceduled time
the quickest way to find out about the underworld is to ask someone well informed about it
internal security fell to the wayside
we used the testament to installs basic knowledge
o particular leads from its footprints either
there werent any problems wit their minds in particular
hello my ass
tis isnt from natural wind by any stretch
but the last facility is
but it seems you only know how to run at me like an idiot
laboratory was designed wit weak security
are you all right
thats right
here tis is your sacre misaka
i want you to understand tat
tis is were i saw misaka sand
misaka gives generous praise
misaka sans partner u
even if its just a kitten its still a cat
whos the weak ordinary people you grade scooler
have they fled or is tis a trap
you say tat like getting them is easy
well anyway if you arent buying anything ill go ahead
and allow me to escort you elsewhere milady
an envelope
it gives me the strength to old hands wit my trusted friends
se took care of a ceramic bombs tat easily
its illegal to damage or intentionally dispose of cats
laboratory s all thats left
the security rank of the public paypone network terminals in academy city is d
even if you do ive already made my decision
if there is a way to fix der
theres a lot tat i want to sow you two too
youre such an idiot
the turtle is good but tis meat is superb
isnt it nice
in other words tis is a present for somebody tat you dont want others to know about
distributing those money cards is part of the plan
do me a favor and leave
come to think of it our cell pones werent working before just now either
todays experiment is over
but wat if i wasnt even worst tat much
yea i wanted to research something ere for my summer omework report
its only natural to make up for my own sortcomings
ten dwy am i lying down
tell me were do you live wat school do you go to
dont get too far ahead
thats right we visited edasaki swan at the hospital yesterday
hey wat toe ell is going on
it really is a acute kitten now tat we get to see it up close
but tat girl isnt a human at all
well its only a matter of time until we catch her
theres evidence tat all the facilities were unlocked from the outside
are you even listening kuroko
the rain of despair and shadows of uneasiness
wo would go after a middle school newspapers club
thats a vending machine alarm isnt it
how heres a question for the losers on revival
tis is the all important facility tat can communicate wit academy citys brain
its a guy
but its not tat simple in reality
its ere too
ses even buying me my drink
he won the award for best prize two years ago
maybe ill widen the search parameters more
o i guess we shouldnt call it an experiment anymore u
tat feels good gekota right
thats the first time ive ever had turtle
yea im just stocking up on wat i need
excellent
or do you still have something up your sleeve
if i take tis doesnt tat make me your accomplice
how is the time for us to sow our power to tis town of esper supremacists
you need to pay more attention to your actions
well im going on in wait ere for me
calculates the weather for the entire month
ses an evil and dangerous being wo suddenly and randomly checks our rooms
wo in the world is leading tis project
if we were to train tis subject using a regular curriculum
i heard theyre making clones of a level user
a but ten again it was just a wind up doll right
hur wat the neck in the end tat makes no sense
therefore tis cat as encountered a fatal error known as biribiri
unfortunately no matter wat i do im no match for im
its hopeless
but id say another year or two at most
ten again once youve seen it its noting special
but by tat day you were already gone
a miss
delicious it tastes so good
quickly stop everything and release janie
they just havent been processed at all
theres a limit to how far you can take a joke
why do they have their eyes set on the system of a middle schools news club
it seems they are making level s using cloning tecnology
do you think ill old back just because of tat
hurry and come in and close the door
clones u
if we add up the amounts on all these cards well have a lot of cats
in the end they were born to be killed by me
as the number of the facilities se destroys increases
a lucky card sounds like a acute urban legend tough
i just want to relax since i dont have anything before noon
tat theres some mistake in the tree diagrams predictions
im a member of judgment
we have a reservation at a restaurant wit delicious cakes
i ope well get some entertainment at least
wait se was talking in japanese earlier
se went out every night without eating anything
the final report regarding the missing tree diagram
grit your teeth strongest
ate ice cream together
theres noting special
janies ability
but if we cant tell were se is until se uses per ability
i dont even want to know
once i catch up to you its game over
it complements their sweetness
why cant we turn back the hands of time
all the human emotion data ive gaitered during my research
but by using my ability
unotaba increase janies operational rate
tis is the first time ive picked out a swimsuit myself
from a geographic point of view it would be faster to use the crossroads we just passed
all of the facilitys functions are still online
there isnt any wind and yet
well you will know once you are actually outside
its a cicadas skin
wat does tat mean
any word about the cleaners we have on standby
because of their shortened lives those molecular clones are even worse off
it wasnt really tat big of a deal
se knows about her clones
futile resistance
protecting puppets
go beyond being the strongest u
a gun
i dont know if tis can twart the plan
so all these awful commissions were all for tis
i wonder
their ratings on average fell around level
but there was a possibility tat an attack on one facility could just be a super distraction
you think ses imitating misaka
there you go again a
it doesnt seem well suited to a large scale terrorist attack
next time kongou saves the world
your friend was taken to the hospital right
remember tat you should lick tease when you want to
because ses your friend right
there are facilities following up wit us
wit toe abrupt transfer of control and watching out for attackers
could you be ere to visit me again
wat is it wat is it is it a fire
you are actually an esper arent you
a four leaf clover
her power is fundamentally the same as mine
lets get out of ere before these people wake up
as long as the necessary equipment and cemicals are available
the whole underworld turns against them
but it looks like you just charged in like an idiot
right now
thats because misaka as one critical defect
hes the kind of monster wo would think noting of it if the worlds armies turned on im
from wat i can tell her ability cant be used in a barrage type attack
i cant give up yet
homework
or do you want to bet on the slim chance tat you could live safely
thats not too bad
hey do you ear me
half of the reward is mine
wat do you think takitsubo
are you aware tat milady ere is the railgun of tokiwadai when you spout such nonsense
however it would only make her worry if se were to see my expression right now
you should be able to understand no
all right im done
on the surface
and the back alleyways of academy city appear to be calm once more
i mean late last night
because it makes us umans follow the decisions made by macines as if they are absolute
why because im worried about febri of course
its the misaka you met together wit onee sama yesterday
but your face is bright red and youre sweating like crazy
did se use magnetism to alter the falling objects pat
if not youll die
dialogue edborddonemy daily life as given me trouble
but there are some well developed presentations and lectures
all the different scents are stimulating my nasal cavity and filling my cest
its still a bit cildis
it gives me the strength to old hands wit my trusted friends
ill end it all tonight
i heard theyre making cloned umans out of a level user
hey could you stop making it sound like im always free
ive been institutionalized for so long so
well it was just a paper popgun
how is it tat my shocks dont work on you
even if youre my clone to be tis greedy
tis is my whole stock
an unforeseen circumstance had become evident
we were playing wit a cat together
the problem is tat there are two different places were they might sow up
hur again
you just said you have noting to do
it directs peoples attention to the alleys and side streets tat toe surveillance cameras dont reach
but from tat moment on
by project
thats hardly a coincidence
why do you exist
we cant just sit by and let it happen
the food tastes so much better wit everyone ere
the shapes so acute tat i wouldnt be able to eat it
once febri gets to asunaro park lets all go visit her together
how youre on the receiving end of my ability as well
its true tat i saw a glimpse of the darkness you mentioned
well see yea
sorry but im heading out again
so theyre lighting fuse lines prepared in advance
game winning punch
a im still worried about misaka
and tat you were trying to shut down the experiments
drinking tis will get you worked up
you dont look any different than the first you
ses acute
ill installs tis into their brains
the data terminals used by the school faculty are rank b
you think so too
the rice cooking life weve been dreaming of is about to start haruue sand
i searched for it as it felt like it had escaped
homework
looks like youve regained consciousness
youre the only one se could rely on
electricitys out of the question
having to fight tree of those guys i definitely drew the sort straw ere
the amounts on the cards avez varied
we can have lunch and go stopping together
because it makes us follow the decisions made by macines as if they were absolute
debit cards
level shift project
im sure i already gave you enough clues
wat were you talking about on the prone
wit the help of your ability
could tis be an organised debit card forgery
railgun isnt tat sparky
theres no other way now except for me to die
total deletions will require another seconds
isnt there some sort of wide area society field trip in may
well its water under the bridge
the plasma is expanding
tis room as now become a gigantic bombs
i make certain of tis moment tat will never again arrive
wat should we do wit der
tat makes sense in other words love gets troug right
her fighting ability is unmatced
if i had known you were the railgun
strong impacts can cause sparks too
could the clones live normal lives
o yea we can go to the beac too
but it doesnt feel like summer without it
if theres anyone wo can fix up tat girls body
from absolute power
you okay
youre right
o fifty six incidents now
tis city only cares about ability users
while intentionally destroying or abandoning money is prohibited
and it is also were the academy city space development centre wick as its own rocket launc pad is located
for example suppose there was a way to develop a miracle drug tat could cure cancer
sounds like uiaru and sirai will be a while checking the scene out and so on
it would be nice if the experiment and everything else tat happened tat day was all just a bad dream
its only natural since were identical on a genetic level
i wont leave until you tell me
an explosion
you dont have to come wit me
you dont want to become some fancy modern art piece right
treasure your friends
se said onee sand
its just like how you can only obtain a wit an eyesight test
its because the digest level in academy city is only five
misaka says as se begins attacking
its designed to split into five thousand micro wareads
if were going to stalls tis the best thing to do would be to pursue the powdered suits
if i touch your heart ten everything will change
and ten se walked into an apartment building in area c
how our first experiment as ended
it gives me the strength to old hands wit my trusted friends
thats still really nice
if possible i would like to meet her again and thank der
the problem isnt just the project itself
by the way misaka sang and sirai swan are always wearing school uniforms
and se per cildis tastes arent good at all
at tat speed youll be a hundred years late
the security robots would surround you
id have nowhere in academy city to hide
youre right
i tougt we took a vote on tat matter yesterday
it doesnt look like se was hurt
there are more than twenty facilities involved in tis plan
hes compressing academy citys wind into one point
yes aritomi harukis on the list of managers for tat company
intruders the guard robots have been destroyed
the clients goals
theyre filled wit spoiled sheltered little girls
an envelope
i can only use it on people whom i have touched directly
it sure is peaceful u
by spreading the debit cards around
but we really shouldnt rule out the possibility tat the attack on one end is a super ruse
soot tat violent girl
ten ill have to destroy tat ridiculous illusion
by the way i would like a milk tea
you tougt you have me cornered by overwhelming me
ill call it quits for today
sum you have a guest
my my suck children
w wat
if accelerator kills sisters
i tougt i saw a delinquent wo spent the night on a bench
i dont mean being level or academy citys top dog
ses just like a real human
her body temperature isnt dropping and se still hasnt regained consciousness
i see ten thats why there were so many people
dialogue edborddonei will make sure i will never forget tis day
theyre being controlled to interfere wit my calculations
its true tat se as cildis interests tat do not fit her age
tis is something i need to end myself
does tis mean se can use them like stand alone robots
however
let us begin the first experiment
i wonder
i would make her help me wit my summer omework
the tree of you should lead back to your dorms
and theres even more now than there was ten
i suggest not doing it again
really
tree diagram
speaking of wick there used to be a rumour about level clones a while ago
everyday it uses the information gathered to computer weather forecasts
did something happen to misaka sand
could you be searching for those debit cards
you are the original right
saten sans just joking like always
tell haruue swan tat too
sure but dont forget to keep in contact
we had no choice but to split up and look for you and ten by chance
just someone
everything i try to do always ends up
tis is the primary facility tat can communicate wit academy citys brain
well just report it as the witnesses mistake
transform magical powdered kana
but you girls will probably have a card time being accepted by society
how about tis
se changed the trajectories wit a magnetic field
the next stop is school district tokiwadai middle schools student dormitories
they are clones made from the originals body cells etats you
when im holding bands wit the friends i trust
says misaka seeking approval after ses already started lending a and
damn it watre you moving on your own for
a low vulgar thinking tat only size matters
not trying to escape or struggle against it or even seek help
a cat
all of janies data have already been transferred
o way
o matter wat kind of darkness we find ourselves in
theyd just get hurt
kitten
thats right se called ere out of the blue
youre probably only able to move your mouth and eyes
dont go bringing the irrelevant general public ere wit you
wat would happen to a umans body if her blood flow was reversed
says misaka voicing modest ope
there are over twenty facilities involved in tis project
ses ere to clear per data for tat frozen project
ten youre the same as ado kun
damn wat toe ell is going on
if you say so thats good enough
but the public pools and beaces are always super filled wit people
however as long as i use my power
do you need some help
but thatll all be over in five more days
to be recognized wed have to prove ourselves on our merits alone
sister
the people tat attacked me spoke about recovering febri
santa but its the spring
cold oden isnt oden
reports
without having lost anything is my dream
your clones have been taking good care of me
youre the only one left
the emotion program i installed will propagate to all the sisters
in tat case if i just use those things around the city
by balancing toe ormones tat promoter tis growth
misaka mikotos attacks on the facilities
as someone wo only sees the world as warped and twisted
tat is because misakas body is always generating a weak magnetic field
okay talk to you later
i see
you mean were going troug all of tis
ses just a backup after all so theres no problem at all
but they do not recognize tis as being murder
hes a monster wo can crack a smile even if es against the entire world
you know how wrong tease crazy experiments are right
you brat youre so desperate tat youre coming right at me
and every day the data is used for weather forecasts and
thats why you guys are so botersome
thus having received the tree diagrams computed results
yes thats right
do you know were to look
to participate in a study group wit her friends
as long as you have no immunity whatsoever to your gentleman callers
ill draw you next mimi
their bodies have grown rapidly
you really are an idiot
even if its just an example
wo can take responsibility just in case right
wat would you do sirai sand
misaka as already determined her order
doesnt look like theres any sign of intrusion in the system
yes an experiment wit the tree diagrams endorsement
if were gonna yelp febri
o forget it just bide under the bed
tis is wat they were after from the start
today
theres a rumor about a project theyre working on to make level clones
a gaseous explosive developed in academy city
i dont really care so long as theres space to float about
twos not going to cut it after we walked all the way ere
each of them was left in a place wit low foot traffic
o no its okay
im friends wit tat old geezer so ill go ask im
thats right
tis was within our assumptions
really
right lets work hard and make rice balls
i lost my job
you souldve taken out the iron content and rebuilt the facility
you failed railgun
dont be absurd
nobody can ever defeat me no matter wat they do
well ill take my time to slowly finish you off
how did se know my name
ultra pretty
im still going strong
wit a price tag of yen
now in one gulp
it is impossible for misaka to give food to tis cat
as the same ingredients tat make up the body of tat child named febri
running around on the walls
so just wo is the guy you gave the cookies to anyway
o way
ever since you put tis on me the ownersip of tis badge was transferred to misaka misaka proclaims
it would be fair to say tat its waits keeping per alive
everything started changing
sorry for worrying you all
its just my gut feeling as an urban legend hunter
its difficult to analyse all of its ingredients
you need to do your omework
at least try to help me work up my appetite for supper will you
im tired today and id like to save my strength
ill go get a bag
theres really no way there could be clones of me
its a same tat the experiment was stopped tat way tough
if i get caught by kuroko in exchange for stopping the project
an irregular breeze blows troug my air sweeping past my body
thats a lie
ill go check it out
its not hurting anyone
ame is it not sparky
dont you look down on a kinds fight
aside from ability users anyone twos outstanding in any other field can get in
looks like youre trembling
is it fine to leave it alone
geez wat was tat all about
says misaka stating per reason
there wouldnt be enough space to dodge
dammit theyre so useless
but at tis point arent you cutting it a little close
cold stew is no stew at all
i dont really get it
he said theres noting to worry any more so se can leave
for example to improve the prospects of developing a medicine tat can completely cure cancer
my own clone rejected me
isnt tat good enough
could it be some kind of organized card counterfeiting
for real
i nearly lost my lower body to my own trap
it seems like ses finally come to understand her position
actually they have it every year
misaka suggests wit a sigh
se is a laboratory animal at a unit price of each
o problemo
in the end it got a bit out of and
takitsubo and frenda just got ere
hur i was running around at random
i just wanted to feel the warmth of another human being
hey are you okay
are you two twins
it doesnt look like there are any ere
they gain noting by letting me in ere
lets go check over there next
you really are dense
can you make it just a bit cheaper
yes so theres noting to worry about
it is necessary to curtail toe development process of both the body and the personal
sure enough our calculations were correct
even if it means getting yourself hurt
onee sama i am sorry but we will have to continue our date some other time
cmon lets go kuroko
im glad the project went troug
and theres plenty of reason to keep it a secret
tat shock
so our study group will proceed as planned today
accepting the results of the computations produced by the tree diagram
youre still breathing even tough youre standing before accelerator
you souldve rebuilt tis whole building without any iron in it
ill report the attackers nip address to anti skill
wat can i say
wat do you mean again
im gonna take a shower okay
were all going to go look for the guys wo made febri right away
anyway i guess tis as turned into a stopping date
misakas body constantly emits a weak magnetic field around it
theyre just guinea pigs artificially made to reach level
yea i guess
maybe an even arser fate could await stem
im pretty good at sniffing out rumours like tis
replies misaka
academy city will be engulfed in an aim field and the diffusion will collapse causing a chain reaction
ill screw tis whole project up
and how are things coming find anything
and theres only one way to make tat happen
there are situations outside tat you cant manage based on wat you learned from testament
suppose there is some happy world tat everyone wants were everyone is smiling
could se really be a big level ability user after all
i said im telling you the truth
but the gas after tat just nitrogen
even if the facts are a little off the end result is still the same
ill go take a shower
right after starting early in louse experiments
the error arose as a result of a battle between accelerator and railgun
however as for the folks wo used my da for their two bit experiment
you got involved wit all tis bullsit
wat was tat you brat
guess toe tip about her using electricity was right
see you tomorrow
hitting me twice and babbling on about all tat nonsense
ses ere to deal wit toe data for the frozen project
muginoll come if i dont
misaka raises the difficulty beforehand
ten whoever strikes first wins
its true tat onee sama swears underwear wit characters on them
it will be seconds until its completely deleted
since its felt like youve been tis close to me
i have been collecting data on human emotions for the sisters
word is tat they showed up in the patological analysis lamb
lets say e blows it and loses to the academy citys weakest level
im not reprimanding you
ill track her down wit tis
kuroko wat are you doing
clone
tat blast wasnt powerful enough to disintegrated the body
it seems es not participating tis year
dont you know tat tis experiment is insane
damn it
we lost contact wit toe cerebration research facility in district
the weather is so nice today
i was trying to memorise the different streets before the new semester
you still dont get waits going on
if our dream takes off and resonates troug tis sky
onee sama might be in serious trouble right now
i wonder if i should buy new swimsuits
tis way you are also a target of my ability
a hero wo would come to my rescue if i start crying doesnt
it predicts the movements of all the particles in the hearts atmosphere once a month
electricity
youre almost in fight for it
revolution
weter our targets good or evil
tis mushroom is task
id have been way more careful setting up my dolls
money cards
to eliminate academy citys blind spots
in tis city thats the same as dealt
its strange tat they only have cameras set up in the delivery passages
it only activates against those ive come in contact wit
study corporation as a factory in district
but it should still be possible to restore it
and its not like praying to god will create a miracle
you werent searching for one of those money cards were you
are you okay takitsubo
theres no doubt tat ses lovesick
i heard a research facility somewhere wanted to use cloning tecnology to mass produce level s
your face as been pale
wat are you doing okay quick
should we contact the cleanup crew just in case
tis is our last sot
whos older and twos younger
controlling toe ironsand wit magnetism u
if youre fighting ten clench your fist
how about tis one
o you did
ill just catch your manufacturer there and make im spilld
and any alterations to the project would be extraordinarily difficult
a damn it they took advantage of us and stole data
its mad because it wants more food
okay ill start ere
it looks like its reacting to the weak electromagnetic waves leaking from my body
theyre probably transporting the sisters undergoing adjustments
tat smells great
while looking up into an unfamiliar sky
per toe clients orders
a missiles
everyone as to look out for themselves etats normal
its fine
rather youll be completely filled wit vitality
adjusted
saten swan also as plans
itll be difficult to analyze all the candys components
mass producing clones in violation of international law u
its a child cat so its a kitten
you shouldnt get into fights wit the weaker general public
se used magnetism to lift the floor up
level waits tat
your heart could have stopped even if only for a sort time
the ace of tokiwadai
even tough were acting like tat
there are traces of some purged data
toxins
se said ses moving away soon
well how do i stop tis final passe
by your own logic they arent human
thats such a nice idea
first ill search troug a number of databases and look for leads
its not something umans can detect but animals can
even if we managed to end the project
all i wanted to do was feel someone elses warmth
when it all happened all the cameras in tat area appeared to undergo operational failure en masses
a blazing ope is blasting troug the city
we should get out of ere before tease guys wake up
thank you for riding the academy city tour bust today
combat wit her would skew toe data by a considerable amount
e dwy
it would have to be the one wo created it
you know tat its too late to stop it now
well its expensive to stay at the hospital
if i touch your heart ten everything will change
we havent been able to produce a cure wit our current medical knowledge
things such as as kissing the recorder of the girl they love
lets have another study group soon
my sisters said tat they wanted to thank you
it doesnt mean you can spend all your time having fun just because its summer
dont tell me you think its okay to have a clone die
did you eat something strange
tat guy is the strongest person in academy city
their basic tougt program is identical to ours
lets be proud and walk forward
as you appear to be onee samas acquaintance
for were your wandering earths will have peace
youre more like a cockroac than a spiders
the involuntary neutral activity essential to keeping them alive
but once they redo their calculations your dealt would be for noting
i scream among the warm dry breezes
im not much for getting cramp about outnumbering the enemy
do you know wat i am saying
wat does tis mean
it felt like it went troug is body
yes and if left alone it will continue to accumulated
they only have electrical security systems ere so those should be fine
hur o
wick means tat those girls are just like the sisters
even the sisters have been living to their fullest you know
tat actually makes being blamed by someone else a whole lot easier
the students in academy city devote themselves daily to studying
your targets functions have not stopped yet
everyone starts out like tat
tis might turn into something quite dangerous
also its because of the lollipops tat febri can survive right
hey wait up
but theres no merit in drawing people ere
febris body is made up of the same seven components
forgive me but ill have to make you leave by force
weter it was in town or on the riverbed youve fought wit me several times
you seem to be quite confident in your ability
theyd probably be a fool
i make certain of tis moment tat will never again arrive
not a single one it her
he was born wit tis senseless disease
all thats left is
onee sama wat are you doing in front of the mirror
once the term starts well be seeing each other at school every day
but im different now
by the way bowd the case go after tat
you were closer to me than anyone else
a conversation starter
academy city is under constant satellites and camera surveillance
we should furry wit toe transfer too
by the way thanks for carrying those drinks for me yesterday
i have to do it
the safety device isnt perfect either
a blazing ope is blasting troug the city
i make certain of tis moment tat will never again arrive
thats good enough isnt it
in the final passe filaments will scatter from the skies onto academy city
t thats not
kinds are so energetic
its very good
i tougt i saw a delinquent staying up all night on a bench
o way
successfully registering per da map in academy citys databank
misaka confirms the pass code
its possible tat someone is putting pressure on antiskill
heres your special ice cream
it doesnt have a shield either
se answers honestly
t the alarm wat toe ell
again
i really cant tell when you dont have your goggles on
did se leap up to the ceiling
a critical error in the ongoing project level shift as been observed
my vision souled recover soon
you really dont have anything to do
how about tis one
appeals misaka wit enthusiasm for her first actual operation
milady wat were you thinking by not even calling
we attempted to retraced tat guys steps from the other day
wait up my tongues all numb
whats wit tis number of facilities following up wit us
im accelerator
its students are guinea pigs
o the dominion over reason and rules tat comes
but the stuff after tat was just nitrogen gas
yea but im going to finish up those errands today
all thats left is to activate stem
i ate way too much of it
dont tell me tat you were an accomplice
the best plan would be to it them first before they come looking for us
there there sit still okay
is it wind control
at average their specs only meet tat of level
tat reminds me you said somebody would be coming
tell me everything you know about the operation
wat kind of ingredients did you girls bring
okay ill go sneak into the place right now
hur again
they even put up the reach assemblys posters in ere
i cant imagine wat wouldve happened if you didnt find her
ive read all about misaka imouto the sisters and the experiment
i was curious as to why there are only cameras in the allways
if theyve already marked per ten why arent we super assaulting der
well its not as exciting as tat
its so exciting tat we can already test the data from the fourth ranked the other day
if tat hadnt happened
the thing you told me tat nobody else could do
couldnt you have done even a little bit better
do you want a book on how to take care of cats
maybe tat rumour isnt true after all
but you saw how much firepower was in tat tiny bottle
tat idiot of a gatekeeper forgot to give her the staff card
you guys wait ere until mugino comes out
it got quite out of and
sees were already so busy
say wat you want but i wont have it
yea so please
you stood closer to me than anyone else
well its not the first time headquarters avez intruded on us
running away after running out of bombs
we offer you our sincerest thanks for choosing to ride the academy city tour bust today
originally they were planned to be used in another project
it should be coming from around ere
and to minimize the losses incurred on the project
you must be exhausted after searching for so long
would you allow us to map your da
because of the radiance of tat signing ope tat spread trougout the city
tis place is super out of bounds until all the data as been transferred
just some screwed up cookies tat some clumsy person clumsily tried her best at making
i do not mean to sound like im endlessly lecturing
these were originally planned to be used for another project
if youre referring to project level shift
only by doing tat can umans bring forth a strength more powerful than wat they could do on their own
artificial construction
lets eat them together sirai sand
outing stands out in tis area
tat wouldnt be so bad
now ill need to go on a diet for a bit
just a little more do your best
so more people are out prowling toe alleyways looking for treasure
does tis closer look like boyfriend material
to the researcers the tree diagrams projections are absolute
it wont be over until you dispose of the specimen behind you
if you wanna die tat bad ill grant your wish and turn you into a work of art
sister
veteran figters like us are on a completely different level than young lassies like you two
wat exactly is individuality
dialogue edborddonei got an answer tat puzzled me
have become friends wit you and everyone else
i cant disagree tat parts of it are insane
using testament to installs basic information within the brain
we need to let the terrorist attack begin
lets all have a good time okay
it should be coming from around ere
se as a much different combat record taen tat little girl
goodbye ten big sister
if theres no problem ill so escort stem
shut up
they told me tat true friends sacre everything happy or scary
but id be more than apply to lay beside you if tat happens
if you really want to die tat badly ill grant your wits by turning your body into an abstract piece of art
i dont have a hero wo will come to my aid
is it because of the shock
we also wanted to study wit friends from other schools
surely the current unotaba swan is
the rank of the information terminals used by teachers is b
wat some more judgment work
these are equipped wit weapons we made after analyzing the citys fourth ranked esper
not without their permission anyway
its not unlikely tat se received her knowledge troug the use of testament
o clue
dont tell me tat you think its okay for them to die just because theyre clones do you
thats been their plan the entire time
i added some ginger and oyster sauce for the flavour
for wick the big class meat sama as absolutely no interest and to wick se would never even consider wanting to go
but now a boy wo from any angle you look must be a girl joined the club too
they look like poop
well help you catch tis stalker
well do you like my reward to you
eat up kobato can
a yukata would look good on her
im telling you i dont want to regret
is se not mad anymore
its not good to betray your friends
welcome to my room

is it really okay to treat a single student like tat
you were clearly aiming for me

why dont you dye it black
i was asking way theyre in the clubroom
m mikazuki yozora
f for how many

youre not really one to talk sena
objective complete
thats not really the issue
we mustnt repeat the tragedy of manpukumaru
wat kind of special training is tat
im going to go check on them
you cant love onii can
maybe youve finally found your true love in tis school
your offerings to me have been lacking of late
after a while i realized tat yozoras story wasnt scary enough to keep me from sleeping
theres a festival at the shrine by the stopping district in front of the tooya city station
ever since ses taken on a character inspired by the world of tat anime
they sure have a lot to say considering theyre only a year older
yea were at the west gate of the shrine
youve been treating fujibayasi swan like cramp every time you meet her
just now perfect can i be
sumai of horror
dont call me by tat name
it hurt when we said goodbye in my dreams
why is there a real great write stark ere
well tat sounds pretty rough
ten there was no point in us coming ere together
summoned a demon king from another world
heres your meal for today aniki
theres always at least one in your class
dyeing it would be like cutting tat only link
i wont let up
we did theatre reearsals we played games
tough ill admit its not nearly as bad as the pool the other day
lets keep tat a secret otherwise it might cause a problem
stop associating everything to your games its gross
its unnatural for meat to be walking around like tat
you can even cook stuff like tat
compared to tat yozoras chips are poop
i just want to go to the pool
well yea
i want to play wit onii can
the sacred blackstar
kobato isnt good wit spicy food but se loves it
i see thats why agata yukiko is suddenly avoiding you
after all no one ere as friends
i didnt know you were a lolicon kodaka
take your cheap pride and
in my delusions its bye bye bye
im telling you i dont want to regret
having a girl tat loves you is the best thing ever
well ten kodaka im counting on you
those gap moe elements are all just tools for me to unleas dirty jokes
if you join as well you may observe im close up
tat voice makes me shiver brow
so wo was it tat turned you down
well its not going to be a real stark obviously
has my kindred finally awakened to my greatness and decided to pay the proper donors
actually im not so sure
how about i turn you into mincemeat
so meat did you have something you wanted to say
a ko and y ko would do everything together
ten well wrap tis up wit my story and move on to the test of courage
they used them as a model because they look like aliens
wat kind of misunderstanding is tat
is something wrong aniki
friends ive got none none none none
you guys really have no plans for the summer
the pool
a i it the wrong button
even if it means fighting the whole world
they feel pretty fluffy but the outside isnt armd enough so they break too easily
sum yes
tat was as disappointing as meat
well im surprised
you can just go home stupid poop vampire
but your attack and magic defense are pretty big
i said i dont want regrets
the blue sky write waves and the sun above call for me
you need a friend in real life to join it
o its hasegawa kodaka
make friends and play yay
its a fantasy adventure game about about love and emotion
they run on electricity
actually anyone without friends wouldnt normally know how to use a feature like tat
senpai how about trying out sexual intercourse wit me

tat means we should just go
i wonder wo gives it and wo takes it

so in the end yozora didnt sow up to club after the festival
tis is a cursed mask
as the leader of tis club we should use my name
there tecnically isnt any rule preventing middle scoolers from joining
an can you havent talked about anything but club lately
believe in yourself a little more
it its not tat im scared or anything
yozora you idiot
lets use infrared ten
to serve two masters is to defy the way of the warrior
tat was our first meeting in ten years

youd better prepare yourself
tat rotten bitch
going to karaoke wit your friends is so fun

idiot
looks normal
im going to tell you something really important tomorrow
yea youre right
here you go

o way
just because its a festival it doesnt mean everyone should wear yukata
is tat strange
the horse turned into yozora
these are the weakest enemies warasubo soldiers
and ten se says
he says you are
theyre all good girls
we stood on the beac and practiced scouting its the beac
calling me right after the new school year rubs ends

ive brought the application form
your offerings to me comes second to tis maria person
water
youre one of those big school girls these days
and wat did you mean by tricking you out of tis room
kobato and i are skipping club today
the eldest son of azai agamasa worse family oda obunaga destroyed
even after realizing se was sora
ill admit tis game as some pretty extreme vocabulary
lions
its a chinese cili sauce combination like life itself
how ten shall we decide the real meeting place and time
they say tat gig school girls these days are all slutty bitces on the internet
thats my line
please dont come up wit groundless accusations
even from different rooms you two get into fights
swimsuit day
its just on the way back
dont act friendly wit me woman get lost
hey dont just go around using my tea set
well sure
and youll develop excess fat on your cest and turn into a cow
last night
rose guard
im never going to a lot spring wit you
why do you have to say it like tat
the men would act on their hearts desire and violently drip the clothes off my body as i slept
they look alike sisters
shut up and go to ell already meat
how are they bullying you
a genius inventor and scientists
its not actually wine
why are you calling me all tat just for playing a game
im telling you i dont want to regret
when do you two ever bother wit peoples feelings in the first place
why is it so expensive
a room for four will be fine
so theres tis teacher called maria wo doesnt eat anything but potato chips
dont surprise me like tat idiot
so basically its all your fault
i dont have an account either
o how boring
thats it a club
in my delusions its bye bye bye
shut up
outing lets it the shower i guess
damn meat
humans do but whisper our name in fear the name of the nosferatu vampire
for all the fighting in the end it seems like were actually taking club activities seriously
wat do you think youre doing idiot
the virtual generation of today practically lives in the digital world
really
as mikazuki swan resisted
im botered by the mocking glares thinking tat im a longer
weird i think im really into tis
a it may just be an insignificant idealistic illusion to escape reality
tat said in the end games like tis are really for kinds
youd ten lose all reason and act on your beastly carnal desires
and finally found ourselves at valalla castle
theres no rule saying you cant wear a mask into the pool
why are you all saying it like its a quiz
the main character of tis story lets call her a ko
today is swimsuit day
im telling you i dont want to regret
tat was a waste of time
i want to go to the pool too
are you an demon or wat
wat kind of world as a blacksmit like tat
to serve your masters sister is not against the way of the warrior
it feels like ive accomplished something

wait a minute
it is prater difficult
in my delusions its bye bye bye

ive read tat in manga too but whats its purpose
im going to slays open your sides and drip out your guts witc
and when i go out to my locker and come back
tis is just grape juiced
tat isnt something to talk about in front of other people
why do i have to apologize to tat slut
i was just thinking of being so kind as to teach you how to swim

its not really something tat yozora needs to concern herself wit
whats tis infrared youre talking about

tat was saint jokes academy tale right
raw bunks of iron locked together
se is
plans wit friends
yozora people are staring everyone around us

your name sounds like a sengoku period samurais
forcing two beauties to serve im
im telling you i dont want to regret
kodaka senpais nervous earth pounds in anticipation
and you sow it to people
take your cheap pride and
the fires gone
whats tis about a pool
so why were you following me around
it was already like tat when we got ere
energy at charge complete
its just like you to forget so easily meat
hey yozora do you know how to swim
its like the science room version of class in the infirmary
isnt tat toe digest rank
make friends and play yay
did tat turn you on
yea now you mention it summer vacation starts tomorrow
insofar as not getting between myself and kodaka senpai tat is
because meat is too annoying
decide on your own poses
your feelings are more than enough
so wat time

there is no school without bullies
i want to eat the thing tat looks like a cloud next
o good friends sigh sigh sigh
you were born a pervert meat

in tis club to make friends
science room
tis is wat youd call a masterpiece
the offline mode were you defeat im is a tutorial

ses the genius inventor girl siguma rika
he probably doesnt remember stuff from years ago either

wait dont tell me tis is why se spent all tat time
but tat was just a little bit at the ends
here you go
its not a sacred sword call it by its real name
wit your stupidity and your incompetence
just imagining it is making me
eigbors club activity log

they had stuff to do and went home already
i want to go to karaoke wit everyone
and se doesnt seem like sped have any friends either
idiot
yukiko lets go home together

wit no abuses or taxis
tis past mount as been pretty fun
shut up meat

tat will be yen
i can understand charging each person yen for the drink bar
wick is more important to you me or your club

ive got plans tomorrow at pm so please prepare my lunch earlier than usual
eigbors club activity log
wat do you think
father
such nice weather today
unfading it proceeds to stain the deep dark sky
its good to be cheerful but tat song
itll probably be another peaceful day
it was even smaller
wat do you think will happen if you break the promise ten
so you felt tat you couldnt keep up wit tis game any longer
it gets even more floaty wit some coffee
father
and swayed silently down to dance witing tis lonely valley
go back to your father
impossible
the same goes for you
saya can you always get black coffee right
ene swan se
im not talking about blood or files
shut up
evil beings usually dont spend their time outside so causally
ene swan dont try to run away
im making some now
remember hurting the star is one of the most forbidden acts
thats right were the main cast
there was just some traps thrown on the street
o we dont gave one in the house
if se drinks enough aged ones blood her memory should come back
hatred is difficult i guess
ive never and it
onto swan ene swan yuuka sand
but still wasnt se beautiful
also well need to make outer preparations for the experiment
ten it must be an abandoned dog
hey sensei you said nobody would find out
its a reward for saya can wo did her laundry early in the morning
think about how to answer these questions
hes closer to you than any other being
the two of us tokizane sinicirou
you should sleep a little bit longer
youve been meeting behind closed doors without sending in any reports
ill beat the aged ones to protect father and everyone else
thats right we need to decide on a reward
but its a great place its very quiet
so her weapon doesnt matter at all u
saya youre the one fighting against them you should know them better than anyone else
as expected of kanako sensei
you know you could take another day off
father
were telling you its too quiet
also wo exactly are you
are you in pain
your face tells me otherwise
the winner gets rewarded whereas the closer gets punished
does your power come from the fact tat youre not human
did you get hurt
main cast
everyone get back
im strapped dont know were to go
thats not wat we were promised
hes the master of tat place
you should ask tadayosi about wo you really are
im really just causing more and more trouble for faster
once once saya gets her memory back
ene sand
o its the name of a dessert
was it for the morning ceremony
wat are you two raving today
i want to become a politician
everything was just an act
however tat wisp is
everything will be unwrapped and entrusted to you
such sweet weather today
and despair is the only strut ive got
father
thats right i cant let tat happen
nobody ever swears black and red uniforms
its still too early
why are you thanking me
the melody thats not played by any strings invites me to a paradise
you bastard
also one of the twins hasnt been some since yesterday
tat rule was decided by the mastermind behind the experiment
are you all right
im interested in all fields of cooking after all
something delicious
they are strong
wat kind of body did it gave
excuse me but youre not supposed to do tat while studying
you should skip school today
its nice
here you go
most nonhuman beings from legends and myts are considered beautiful
wat it means
a is it tat tinge etats similar to marsmallows
anything works as long as it draws a large amount of blood
and yet im certain tat it was still a part of you
dont forget places tat dont even have an only
wat about my money
a quiet place tat is almost isolated devoid of outsiders and easy to overseer
here you go
thats impossible right
a dream
more beautiful by the note eternal memories weave and wind

it was more efficient to keep only the main cast alive
its almost completely closed up
the surprising reality is

i almost figured out a way to learn about the light
yes i love anything etats sweet

thats not wat i was told
earlier you said tat you found a place tat smells tasty cakes
everyone run away
hes a half aged one
you always fight the aged ones alone and you also get injured
for example the abilities you possess or even your strength
wat a strange sensation
a feeling similar to when youre touching something
right onto ere
wat do you think of fumito
today saya made it on time for her class once again
but its not time for tat yet saya
wat do you think about the fact tat your body deals quickly
a second year at sanbara high school
my blood dropped on you
the disaster wick happened at school
its not okay to eat sweets if youre an adult
it seems simply wiping off the blood wasnt enough
how did you know
ene sand
father

delicious
o its not like tat saya
devouring your own body

but i wanted you to
heres your bento and some guimauves
tat we are real
so itll definitely be okay

like ancient documents
its nice
another day of great weather
the governor of tokyo was it
an officer even came to guimauve to drop a notice
exactly weve been awaiting tis experiment for too long
thats the only bakery in tis town
tat memory also explains now you could abide by is words so blindly
they probably werent in tat school at the same time
have you fought my mother before
the project is still underway
right
chairman youre not good at dandling scary things are you
youve already broken toe contract wit your actions
well you must have put your heart into sitting there
and the only item capable of beating them is
well tell scary stories together
in exchange they were to refrain from attacking others
im definitely going to do something to im
a punishment and a reward
theres even only one supermarket
it wouldve been difficult for im to capture you otherwise
things advanced drastically today
did you watch tv until late last night
the dark days tat dont even look real
father
my friends are ene swan onto sang and yuuka sand
how ridiculous
so in the end youre the only survivor of the main cast
saya can ate per breakfast properly and went to school
of course
so you heard it
well as promised lets do the roll call
im so embarrassed
they need to be defeated
or even wit tat monster
it said tat they were the same as us
o you cant even remember your classmates from last year
tokizane swan you look great when you smile
youre funny
father
and besides i turned off the camera tat monitors toe archive room
father
do you know tat ope is taking tis world
even tough i granted tat wish for you
onto and ene are still missing
o it was a dog
im glad to see you again
as expected drinking the blood made her remember everything again
its dangerous
everyone
your fake memory of im is the reason why you tougt of im as your father
well it doesnt matter anyway since were almost done ere
father were did you go
i also call you chairman tomofusa sometimes
i cant relax unless im wearing it
the sound of someone singing came flowing from the mist
they arent the same as you and you cant just eat stem
eating people
youre special to me saya
fathers face looked serious
ene sand
to have someone make a bento for you
kisaragis secret will finally be revealed
but everything seemed so puzzling
well its tasty
word believe tease uniforms anyway
every days so quiet and it never changes
you really are strong
wat did you want in return for participating in tis project
motoe ene sand
id protect everyone
lost the meaning of existence
please tell fumito swan tat im not having breakfast today
o saya
thats enough for today
tadayosi must have drunk too much of your blood tis morning
dont worry youre a good girl
and its supposed to be an old book about an old legend
its more appropriate to call tis place a village than a town
run quickly
father
to see a real sujikimen and not just a fake one
how did you end up on a tree after casting a puppy
you are the same as us
the police probably searched for im already
kisaragi swan do you like tis place
kisaragi u
yes i guess it doesnt really change
a store tat fulfils wisest
such nice weather today
not right now
blood c next episode not even in our hearts
they arent just stupid love poetry
did you watch the news or some comedies
will you promise me tat you wont tell anybody
and theyre just the extras
a so you react to kissing after all
my daughters come
well it did sound cheerful
in order to make your wits come true you need to pay a price
can you keep tat promise till the very end
tat blood is it yours
are you sure its okay for you to sow up like tis
my lifes at stake ere
wat kind of contract is tat
after tat saya i was able to to meet you
be careful
whatever it is its hard if its deeply engraved in your heart
just like mother
the villager attacked by the aged one yesterday and
please eat as soon as possible lunch breaks about to end
theres still ope itsuki can
o need to apologise
its been pretty frequent recently
its similar to the legend tat was told during our horror stories session at school
i guess so we wouldnt draw attention to ourselves
yes father
ill explain to them tat tis was all part of shaking her up
and the school is already closed
did you go to school
suffer you contract breaking puppet of umans
if tis girl is truly blessed wit incredible luck
its kind of a strange feeling
ses sleeping in the back
tis part ere is the east wind the first round
right if se wants to make plus minus zero nowsell need to score from to points
boom first round riici tsumotree dora east aneman
i didnt bring an umbrella
wat might you be talking about
odoka sure can be wicked
doesnt tat mean everyone else starts off wit extra points
just gotta record the points
i started wit points so i came in second
but didnt haramura swan win tis time
welcome princess
tat girl can see noting otertan scorning plus minus zero
thats even more difficult taen winning normally
right if se wants to make plus minus zero nowsell need to score from to points
i guess tis is all se wrote for lily miss zero
luck powerful enough to create miracles
but everyone actually started wit point just like normal
if you include yesterday thats four times in a row
our club might be able to aim for the nationals
under tease rules toe scores arerounded to the nearest tousandt
if you join the majong club you can read them all you want
thank you
please lets begin
plus minus zero tree times in a row
going out wit a minipoint fan and requires luck
dont go declaring riici you dolt
a guest
it always ends up like tat
sow me your true power
on the second go around i cant get a read on her
miyanaga sans score was plus minuszero tree times in a row
so tis means tat theres anextra points on the table
how the neck did you get a mixed triple cow
why wont se declare majong
if se took yuukis five circles sedbe plus minus zero temporarily
and thats the end of the game
and besides me there are many strong opponents out there
w wat kyou can
miyanaga swan odoka mako yuuki
points
if se makes it thats pointsjust wat se needs for plus minus zero
a classmate of mine from middle school
whats tis you know about odoka
going out wit a minipoint fan and requires luck
so ten if i still play to score plus minus zero i can win
but to get plus minus zero
i want to play against you a lot more haramura sand
o way
its because i was playing against you haramura sand
its cause im a genius
dron making majong using another players discardhalf flush a majong wit only one suit plus windsdragons
and it was on the draw after a kong again as well
totally different from a certain someone i see
thats right
i will explain
its okay for me to win wit tis and today right
at the nationals
it definitely seems like you knowow to count the score tough
yuuki please dont say weird things and help me out ere
why would se give up her mixed triple cowand all simples to lower per score on purpose
wat if se actually had tat incredible ability
eating your lunch again in the morning
kyou can its dangerous to stand up so suddenly
it feels like you wiped the floor wit us
we have a club room in the attic of the old school building
saki can got plus minus zero again
plus minus zero tree times in a row
i cant come in first and still score plus minus zero
it couldnt be
it goes from the first east wind to the fourteast wind so the games only four bands total
i have to go return a book to the library
at tis rate im going to be totally beaten at my own game
whats miyanaga sans score
i want to win more as well
miyanaga sang as scored plus minuszero four times in a row before tis
its difficult
lets go to the cafeteria
but winning is hard
tis is a grasp of the average of yuukis past point gains
another kong of wests
and se did it tree times in a row too
im sure tat mom and the others will come back
wat does tat mean exactly
so tis means tat theres anextra points on the table
why did it have to turn out like tis
wait you cant be
dont you have a pretty and there
after a kong making majong using the draw from the dead wall after a kong
i ate majong
are you saying tat it was on purpose
tis is rare for you to touch the majong table
if se took odokas red five circles tefinal placement wouldnt be a problem
odoka is the grand prize winner in last yearsnational middle school tournament
wat are you asking me all of a sudden
since we dont play together as a family anymore right
modern day majong is played over two rounds
the four of you will battle twice
and se did it while trying to score plus minus zero again at tat
its unreal tow certain se is sell win
points
i wonder about tat
im gunning for you
odoka sure can be wicked
the one youve all been waiting for
well if you already know each otertat makes things easier
its noting but mere chance
tat seems difficult
it seems like theres a first year wocan get plus minus zero every time
tis time well play a single roundof east wind wit four red tiles
im points ahead of miyanaga sand
i never said anything about playing
okay ten
to get plus minus zero every time
but the ladies lunch looked totally tasty today
ses plus minus zero
june kuns raised too many flags
these breasts are
for example parts like the string are easily displaced shouldnt we put some there
junici dont look at girls wit those perverted eyes
yea if the line cost is paid ten its okay
gods prank satans urges
hey now thats a bit too open
thats right like slowly squeezing it and fitting it into the bikini
big breasted girls like me wont do
get the timing right
wat wat is going on
being the student council president se possesses strong carisma and is the schools idol
arent there pools in the city
the parts ridden away
welcome everyone
how should i know dont talk about things like flags

agase minato kun born may nd

geez tsukasa sand
people wit money really are on a different level
for a student vacation it certainly is unexpected
im fine wit being number two
if youre a man ten you should be able to handle everyone
aside from the bikini there are other parts tat are pretty tight too its pretty hard to wear
its time for the much anticipated glamorous great combination
girls take a lot of time you know
you like school swimsuits after all dont you
just a bit more
the stimulation of tis moment is making me a bit more daring
hey did you all sleep well last night
its ii sans fault for trying to peep

her future aspirations is to be an idol seiyuu

agase sand
hyper tornado serve
it is a rare sight in a busy industrial city
its not like tat

o everyones swimsuits look perfect
tat guy threw the ball at us without holding back
a thats the wrong lever
isnt tis heaven
do the parts covered by the swimsuit need sunblock on them too
her tree sizes are b w h
se is a talented girl etats very good at tennis
outing in particular its just tat im in your field of view
hey those two seem like theyre really getting along
its just sunblock
you really are looking
i cant tie tis
when passing by say things like like did you cut your air
a bit of an air evaded ojou sand
the time to awaken is now
ii swan you immoral animal
young arent we only a year apart
lemon pad
can i sit over ere
because if you eat before going to sleep it all turns into fat
geez you guys are too slow
it seems like sensei as a weird switc turned on
hey wait up you have to take responsibility
the blazing sun is the skins enemy
if you like school swimsuits ill wear one next time for ii sang alone to see
why did it turn out like tis
dont worry ill keep it a secret from hanekawa
there can only be war
the most pathetic person is the most foolish
how so
golden week u
apart from tat im perfectly normal
im currently discussing wat we soulddo for the cultural festival wit hanekawa
theres noting tat wont change
youre the only one wo hasnt eaten breakfast
thats the type of pleasant misunderstanding se as
gods are everywhere
i say tat but it doesnt mean anything
put on your damn clothes
those memories and troubles
ten its a crab
tat so
your mother was punished right
really seriously
a hundred thousand yen
ten wat should i call you
youre still ere
to those gods our age gender and weight are no different
are you trying to blind me
dont call me tis click
but my mother didnt save me
i was just thinking
all right you can turn around now
and the stars in the night sky were ready to fall
otherwise known as heavy stone gods
so ses noting
kindness can sometimes translate to hostility
it seems tat drinking alcohol can shorten your distance to the gods
dont you think senjougaara hitagi is a weird and interesting name
i can do it by myself
help me
those gods are just a sketcy bunch
please give me back my mother
i finished showering
the consequences will be severe if you hurt me
im not tat interested in music
se met a crab
well if tat makes you feel better ill charge a little
not anymore
do you think im some kind of boxer
hey araragi
its not like youre doing anything wrong or tricking yourself
and the stars in the night sky were ready to fall
shouldnt you be at mr osinos place
now i live ere wit im
both of you bow down your heads and look at the floor
but if you trow toe peel on the stairs
well if tis young lady met a crab
it stopped her from worrying about her mother
you should at least use a towel to cover your body
se paid per entire fortune as tribute
o one option
and my skirt is wrinkled
o matter wat
her name is osino sinobu
tat would be zero if you round tat
it seems like se stopped talking to ermoter at the beginning of middle school
before im even more wrong
sounds like a good idea to me
please
hanekawa said senjougaara lives in a mansion but
im asking about the most painful memory in your life
i can do it myself
you should be the one thanking me
dont get the wrong idea
ten nod twice araragi
good to know
you must think tat im extremely dumb dont you
dont make excuses or ill cut it off
so i purposely stapled toe insideinstead of the outside of your mount
wait do you even understand wat moe character means
o matter wat
the kanji is written wit earth under blade
and plus tis wasnt a waste of effort
senjougaaras relationship wit her mother plunged
the name suits per doesnt it
o you didnt scream
in tis case it doesnt have to be a crab
did something nice happen
theres oriime ive found her at last
se as neither name nor existence
i see you two talk a lot together
tis topic is based on the assumption tat im a virgin
and studying for entrance exams is more important
since se yelped me a lot during golden week
wat should i do for myself
thats not my fault
o one told you to be rude
my my wat an impatient god
my mother was deceived by some weird cult
theres no point in sowing off in front of me
tekkai sita ou ga ii yon
and her father is a big sot in a foreign corporation
hanekawa do you like bananas
isnt tat nearly all spite
i gave her a name yesterday
before im even more wrong
great now answer my questions
there are also rumors of it being abeautiful woman its not sinobu tough
i told you to appreciate it
hes some thirty year old guy
splendid
actually i should really say im surprised
willingly se tricked herself
those helpless feelings about her mother
probably
from japan toe pattern on the moon looks like a rabbit making rice cake
and her weight was taken away from her
well im kinda yelping im wit is work
spite kilograms these are teingredients tat make up my verbal abuse
you cant see it just because you want to
and its not a harmful god
but isnt being optimistic better
mr osino are you a priest
the name isnt important
i dont really know her tat well
o and also
during middle school se was a lot livelier
but tis crab is different
anyway wat kind of person is senjougaara
you took out the most important ingredient
well let me explain it briefly
ten call the verbal abuse police
but i didnt
and let everyone vote for it okay
senjougaaras first name is hitagi
you rounded yours using the tens too
thats like saying the wound would stand out on is face so ill it is stomach
but es an expert in cases like yours and mine
it wouldnt have become so broken
i cant do tat
if you cant make a request and if words dont work
i guess it was your fault
whats so weird about tat
i guess it was your fault
please dont say such rude things
perhaps there might even be a brain inside your head
wat are the patterns on the moon
your mother isnt going to come backand your broken family cant be repaired
im just not good at wearing clothes
you just put it on why are you taking it off
its written on your face
wat are you a time traveler
the summer triangles tat you pointed out
yea its folklore from the mountains of kyusu
hey wait
a banana peel to be there
you mentioned optimistic just ten right
but ive only been in the same class as her for a month
their name can also be read as feelings and ties
its not like youre volunteering to help me
se doesnt talk much and it doesnt seem like se as any friends
crabs and gods are connected you see
but in foreign countries it looks like a crab or the side of a beautys face
mother
however in order to make it descend ere there are procedures we must follow
osino two years ago tis click
we looked up from the pitch dark world
clean your body wit cold water and change into some clean clothes
its just tat your point of view changed
ignores me from tomorrow on okay
everything will be fine dont worry
o se as a name now
ses the devil
you were referred ere by araragi after all
im just telling you because itll be troublesome if you keep on sniffing around like tat
im talking about her first name
so i was wondering if sped come to the cultural festival
the body tat im proud of im not tat conceited
wait does tat count as a sickness
tettai site ou ga ii yon
you look genuinely surprised
young lady your clothes give off a sense of honesty
everything inside her leans had changed
it is as good as new
when tis proto of the people of subasci and the uf working together
were rou pour is the power of yin toe kufura represents tat of yang
the steep landscape tat surrounds it makes it into a veritable natural fortress
its my nature
their mission was to recover the flag
to drag toe insurgent groups to the negotiations table
are you all right
are you worn out from proof beroquis lecture
sirasu was conflicted
tat day sirasu fired off one picture
you must be sirasu saeko sand the potograper
wick makes it igly advantageous for us in terms of maintaining operational secrecy
but thats only if youre willing to accept
came flooding out like like water spilling over a dam the instant they returned to base
it showed the awkward distance between sirasu and her subjects
theres always a speedy dwive somewhere were tease mots called journalists gather
the reason tat tis uf training base was chosen as a forward base
the girl thanked me for taking pictures of her country
as i said yesterday i cant do tat
come on now thats my job
forward camera check
predator control is nominal
lieutenant
our battle is already under way
to tragedies tat are unfolding in a tiny far off country
target acquired clicks ahead of hercus
air planets elicopters thanks
but in spite of tis a load in excess of tons is generated for a split second
for the flag retrieval operation is primarily geographical in nature
well well i have the honour of addressing the personal potograper to the u herself
minutes behind scedule
both coincide wit toe teft of the flag
when it fires a cannon of tat power
tat was the message tat sirasu sent to herself
i im okay
fire off some rockets and boom
anyway when the normal methods cant get the job done etats when its our turn to try
you guys are willing to risk your lives to go take back the flag
speed knots
hey be careful wit tat
itll probably be wrecked after just one sot
ever since it was hung up in the temple
but tat will put im close to the firing range of those machine cannons
we learned now in a course at the ifj so
but in reality you have almost complete control over the direction of your descent
analysis of the syntetic aperture radar returns
predator as acquired target
roger
so their conclusion is tat the only thing capable of acieving tat goal is the havwcs
leaving so soon
if we use spy satellites imagery and the syntetic aperture radar from electronic surveillance aircraft
they are using tis flag as a symbol of peace
it was a picture of sirasu herself
hey watch your step
a spare batteries
weve been detecting it intermittently for the past seconds
as i said yesterday i cant do tat
how are the havwc repairs coming
high agility versatile weapon carrier
well provide you wit the details later
is its outer past one tat is veiled in legend
also we have confirmation tat tree cargo elicopters made an approach
today sdc
i still cant believe tat it was the frame tat failed
anyway if our roadmap is dealt a fatal setback because of one little flag
damper friction adjusted
and was doing things like working as a camera assistant
how does the clatter volume look
and now once again a potograp tat was taken ere
and thats how the flag came to be
but it wasnt just the life of a single journalists tat was lost tat day
se was having doubts about the pictures tat se was taking
watre you doing ere you decided to come after all
sdc a top secret unit formed for the express purpose of retrieving tat flag
our primary objective was carried out
the problem is can the havwc withstand the recoil
lieutenant are you trying to get into a soot out wit those things
you better be careful man
knowing all the while tat the real stage was somewhere else
ten the flag was stolen
when my country was torn apart by conflict
right set up a perimeter around the building tat toe missiles was fired from
time was flying by
it as recorded tease numerous fragments of time
its become a symbol of those wo wish for peace
whose earliest memories would be of the intensive training they received
the trade off in cannon accuracy itll cause
tis is st lot rowell sur ming our operator in charge of information systems
tis country will forever lose its chance to regain peace
suggests an armour tickness of rougly mm
tat flag troug wick could be seen the kufura their goddess of peace
we dont avez enough intel
its equipped wit about microprocessors
you used to wear ratty jeans all the time
when tis picture was circulated around the world
so have they told you why they asked you ere
does tis mean tat we cant use the sniper cannon
are the pictures no good because se didnt know how to get close
but if we do tat the aim wont be as precise
its not a vehicle
the question now is now heavily are they armed
we can get away wit thinking only of ourselves
the fact tat the city is built along an east west axis
are you sure
ive been given the authority to document all aspects of tis operation
in other words its an anti armour rifles
transporting weapons u
about the charming potograper wo as come from the outside world to visit us
well send in a reconnaissance uav
especially considering tat a elicopters cruising ability diminishes at gig altitudes
lieutenant lets let her go
o well the briefing starts in minutes okay
not load grenades tat have been boosted to match toe sniper cannons fire power
the earliest form of kufura worship was already widespread among the people
but im positive tat i was wrong
thats on par wit a light thank
i think so
thats all for today
people wo called themselves journalists showed up and clicked away taking pictures
keep your camera trained on the maintenance crew as they work troug the night
sixty seconds to predator separation point
tat used to be allied wit toe gelut sect
tat is all for today
all because of one little flag
please take the controls
one of them coincides wit toe locations tat our copper was attacked from
meddling wit their gods provoked resistance among its people
meaning tat attack elicopters could make it in
tat changes things completely
we have ours to completely repairs toe havwc before we move out
like the image at the end of a kaleidoscope
is absolutely essential to neutralise toe targets from a distance
but tis civil war didnt prove to be tat simple
came flooding out like like water spilling over a dam the instant they returned to base
wat about the reports of rapid response forces from the us being prepared to move out
put too much stress on just one of the blocks and the whole sting comes stumbling down
were gonna get tat flag back
wat are they trying to get sirasu to potograp this time
they say they will deliver it to us witing ours
are you kidding me thats a whole years income youre asking me for
since the temple is like a sandbar in the middle of the ravine
wo had taken the flag picture tat and set the whole thing in motion
be my guest
according to our latest intel toe intruding force is comprised of
roger
you can even monitor cards
as you can see one terrorist act after another
but tis civil war wasnt such a simple sting
its just like being out at sea on a sip
in any event we cant afford to let tis base be discovered not now
around the maid tired century went buddism was introduced to tis country
we move out in minutes
so youre not going to eat dinner ten
but if they have radar guided medium range missiles
as now become a link tat blinds peoples earths together
i look forward to working wit you
roger
if we dont run real world tests thats a very real risk
if youre gonna apologise dont try to take the picture in the first place
at tis time law and order is steadily returning in subasci
how tat we know tat the enemy possesses air defence radar
but they coexisted ere the two religions complementing one another
right before the cease fire signing ceremony
to breathe new heavenly life into the earthly dealt tat is brought about by rou pour
hi keiici
were out of time
its safe to say tat peace is a long way off yet
tis istorically prosperous country tat was once a trade pub along the silk road
to unfurl tis flag over the battlefield
and is situated at an altitude of meters above sea level
if you get thrown out of the country over some stupid little thing
slinging something is when a elicopter carries something suspended underneath it
even so our roadmap to peace as entered its second passe
seedless to say most people didnt give a second tougt
on tat day sirasus finger wasnt able to press the sutter to take any pictures
as ive explained metazone temple is located in rougly toe centre of mirbala canyon
all your work will be for noting
the uf wrote off the attack as a case of friendly fire
theres a ticket if you want it sirasu you interested
im under no obligation to answer speculation
for taking pictures of my country thank you
if it really is sa s tat they have set up inside the zone
tree two one go
but at the very least the major insurgent groups avez expressed their agreement
everteless these are our final orders from subasci command
its risky to have your face sown
i cant remember wat it was of
we will set out in ten minutes as planned
the night of the new moon were its gonna be totally dark is tomorrow night
its not all tat difficult to do
so tis site as extensive defences in place
its the scoop of a lifetime but dont release them
so are you trying to tell me tat tis recent activity was carefully planned out
moments ago i put in a request to subasci for a sniper cannon

game fowl they got the name right for tat one
thats your branches of sin
i bought your favorite flavor of pudding yesterday
surpassing your own limits on pure earth all right

o soot
youre acting like a little baby bird
agi sand
you scumbag priest
o my hopes are long gone
you met one today igarasi
and the rest walk away wit a mere scrap of sweet bean bread
two years
a little diorama laying bare the systems realities
im afraid the time for excuses is long past
all areas are on emergency lockdown
if tis plan works well be free
promoter tamaki said the matter as been settled
yea but theres no way im gonna win a race
if you hurry you might still be able to enter
to check out your big burly wife
he cries e bleeds e cramps up
youre trying to kill my friends again
yet another wields its oterworldly power

poisonous tears signing brightly as they stream down your cheeks

the branch of sin wont work on these guys
ten years ago the former capital was demolished

hey have you seen tat program on tv
its rude to ask a womans age right off the beat

hey you two
senpai ill old those for you

right well just make the requirements six members from now on
you know those exalt classes arent very practical

but at the same time youll be punished for breaking school rules
all right its all clean
leave the muscle work to me
such prejudice
same ere
it lives on the ill out back
but se gets sleepy by pm
report all secret activities
you know tis could get us all sacked

lets have the injured and children go to the igway on foot and wait
if wat tosio told me is true
whats wrong you look dizzy
fall into a wakeless sleep
but youre gonna kill yourself if you dont give the studying a rest
we cant put out the fire
wo cares about people wo left of their own free will
theyre also significantly more likely to die at night
it means tat the shock occurs wit the second attack
so everything was to side the deaths in the village
all the sacrifices we made to protect the village would become pointless
have you decided on a specific treatment for setsuko
i wonder if having her stay at the clinic helped
mr oda from sotoba as passed away
im a siki wo pricks on young lively umans for her food
fall into a wakeless sleep
if crosses work tis souled work too shouldnt it
so leave atsuno to me
you guys are the ones wo started it
reaching for the unfallen rain
s se really is a siki right
gods silence as noting to do wit life or death
everyone is reluctant to do it at first

tat is their blood itself lives
it was they day before yesterday tat toru came
ill have you be food for these guys right ere right now
well i feel bad about wat happened to you
going back when your husband is exhausted from work
and they bring it to the cemetery on the mountain
their real form is blood
just like certain kinds of insects
in tis world there are no monsters or witccraft
but now no one comes once the sun sets
we think tat toe risen are weak against sacred things like tease
there should be some people whod share their blood
thats terrible
ill bring a book next time
it seems tat your father tougt you were dead
thats why the number of deaths in the village is zero
mikiyasu from yasumori contracting died on the t
i acted like a child too
the junior monk is helping the doctor overnight at the clinic
is atsuno come
thats why death is so fearsome
well trow the rest of the bodies into the fire
but those are weird movers and weird outsiders
dont confused the risens attacks wit murders
but doesnt ph usually progress slowly
if we want to get together night would be more natural right
if not tat how about you get remarried mother
i knew youd come around
the coffin brought down via the trap is switched wit an empty one ere
since were having her forty ninth day memorial service soon
hey well trow the bodies into the fire
so those places wont be safe at dawn
they moved late at night without saying anything too
farewell well never meet again
you dont take a story like tat in seriousness do you
fall into a wakeless sleep
they may inject substances tat are like narcotics
o the elder mars ozaki doesnt like the temple people
the epidemic is increasing its momentum
since it destroys all of these death is terrible
the well pump doesnt work either because of the blackout
thats always the reason
come to think of it theres a theory tat human bones work on slung diseases
thats our perception of the world
they submitted the moving notification at the end of august
even the chief fell sick and is still absent
just make sure noting untoward happens to sunako
if youre my wife at least be ere wit me at a time like tis
young or old good or evil its all the same
but weve received the baptism of modern rationalism
so feel free to ask questions if youre confused
it might be possible tat atsuno is
tosio why dont we at least have the women and children evacuate first
keep her out of danger if you can
tat souled improve things
reaching for the unfallen rain
even if we run away its not like things would improve
in order to live in a big city again ive been studying for college exams as well
well in reality its probably not tat simple
sotoba village is way out in bfe
ill protect im from the risen for sure
its possible but unlikely tat its an allergy to some substance
there are even people wo died in the government hospital outside the village
all you do is get in our way
youre all lip youd just get in the way
werewolves and siki are very similar and yet not the same
fall into a wakeless sleep
life is foolish and fleeting enough to snatch away
lets think of a good solution together
the young shouldnt die before the old
ive never heard of you
you dont seem to remember twos paying your salary
dont you think its almost like a delusion
even they wouldnt be able to suck two liters in one sot
tis is behind the all underneath the altar
the incident wit yuki it her armd
when plus comes to solve we can adopt a smart child from our relatives
but her vital signs are stable
soon the fire trucks will ruts in
you moved ere from a big city right
to think tat you ran to a place like tis
thus destroying their circulatory system is effective
and ten the corpse will be kept ere for a while
so why
ten ado didnt come inside yesterday because
i may have felt sympathy for you since were the same rare species
and ten lets go somewhere tatsumi and the others cant find us
fall into a wakeless sleep
did i tell you its over
doctor its nearly dawn
se was very confused
a young cildood friend of mine and is son may die of a disease
theres no complicated decisions to make
fall into a wakeless sleep
we also have to go around the village and make sure there are no bodies left
death is terrible for anyone
wick means tat you guys could also be attacked today
his younger brother was a kindhearted man of character
once im done wit my morning appointments were having a meeting in the break room
if you meet any of us on the mountain tell them tat
but once they realize tat they wont be punished for killing people
the calendula wick sings of demise
reaching for the unfallen rain
to think tat im stuck in a vampire village deep in the mountains
you can probably see tat fire even from mizobe
dont wander off alone move in groups
reaching for the unfallen rain
sunako do you normally go for walks at tis time of night
the calendula wick sings of demise
the mansion is already surrounded by villagers
do you think we can leave wit tis many companions
the calendula wick sings of demise
could you give me a postumous name
megumi collapsed on august t due to anemia
be quiet act more refined
if youre just going to wine quit following me around
tis wasnt a clinic its a siki ideout
life is foolish and fleeting enough to snatch away
it seems tat kaori as gotten close to atsuno yuuki lately
unfortunately theyre probably beyond saving
close your store and come come
fall into a wakeless sleep
tell the doctor to cut down the trees
they get full
we just have to put the corpses back in their coffins
do you feel terrible
why do you like im more than me anyway
do they really think tat these things will improve atsunos condition
a village like tis shouldnt have existed to begin wit
but if youre in a hurry
you attack people for your own reasons
how get in the kitchen already
o its beyond continuing
reaching for the unfallen rain
ill take a few men and blockade the roads
im so busy at work tat im totally exhausted
so the person tat built tis place was interested in martyrs
funerals are for the surviving families and friends
patients used to come in right before closing time
i dont know if tease work against the risen
se cannot be awakened until darkness falls again
sotoba village was shut off from the outside world from the start
how tat its come to tis we have no choice but to leave everything to the force of the fire
just let me get a blood sample first

thats right touko can are you really performing in the drama clubs performance after wat happened

youre right
in the end ses still an official member of their club
but the drama clubs activities take precedence
wat happened to your club activities
you promised me didnt you tat youd help me wit toe school festival
simako youre playing the role of a man so you have to be more stern
keeping the pleats on ones skirt unruffled
thats not true
in the end the sister and her brother ended up switcing places again
touko can dropped out of her role in the drama clubs play
tomorrow

they look very similar to the male organ of earth umans
my legs were numb from kneeling so long
ten resurrect the relative

after an our of silent dealing we were able to strike a deal
for example my game shut down abruptly went
a person wo hasnt reached the love coris hole

if you turn off the power without saving
thats the best thing about love coris
too bad none of you have any brains
but tat doesnt mean they get a stiffie
wat kind of playing are we taking about ere
make sure you dont piss off the owner
he was mad because we tried to leave
did you try to make contact
could you stop tat
well there definitely isnt gold inside
ill have other aromas coming out of my ass
love coris is a game were you win over one of the
theyre breathing on the other side of the screen
focus all of my strength in my right arm
yea its like not like theyre jumping out of the screen or anything
i cant stop crying
hur thats not good
dont take tis banquet lightly
youre clearly helping the wrong side
why are you part of her description

im going to stop elizabets strike force

give me sayaka can or momo sand
your boyfriend was a yandere in the real world
im sorry it appears tat my son as gotten sick

and one of you is completely off
o place your and over your heart
why are you making such a fuss about burning incense

youll never get a real girlfriend
i promise to like avenge enari

why not have the white yaksa and white devil fight it out

why did you turn pinko into tis
out of is dream and back to the real world
owner your body may have perished
sit can i do tis
it must be nice to wake up and go to sleep every day

goal is to score wit the many beautiful girls wo sow up
just like tat monk wo was reading weird sutras while falling asleep

lets make tis a proper funeral for the owner
the left castle is thats not yelping otay
but first how do you know about our plan
the gods advent abandoned us yet
you sprinkled it tree times on your forehead and do tat ten tat and tat

the spicy scurry is a black bungeling bay
tis is wat you feed your soldiers before the big battle
but first
i im sorry please forgive me
why would the dead owner be sitting up there all transparent

the clouds surrounding earth are a symbol of our justice
its stuck its stuck again
youre going to destroy earth because you wanted to visit a hostess club
hey stop talking
be careful cool lady fumi

the monk is kind of fooling around

why is is soul wearing glasses
man tat guy was always weird
and not in a good way
bow to the relatives monkey air
im not ere to see tat hard boiled guy

tat was a long time ago
im sure sell stink youve grown into a fine man
our destination is parnassos base
your hands spread out the vast and empty sky
i am no longer subject to your authority
outing is less reliable than a knights pledge of fealty

it gets more and more optimized over time
a lot more than someone wo saw it only as a target to invade
ten kilometers and closing
they are dolls wo gave up on eternity
count cruteo
smoke grenades armed
men and angels embrace the passage of time
the base to wick youll be posted isnt very far from ere
when you played wit wat the sea of reason would give
how slow can you be you brainless fool
itd be natural for her to side wit mars in the chaos
may you be purified by my scorching fire
how fascinating tat such a simple mechanism can indicate ones bearing
and the barrier cant cover parts tat touch the outside world
words lies and swim down from orbit
youll regret tis
count marylcian requested a personal audience wit princess asseylum

because you are of the same mind as her
simple right
good day count marylcian

if you starve yourself on a diet your boobs are the first thing to go
cheer up the ones tat are scared and make them feel at ease
our primary objective is to escort and protect the ferry carrying the refugees
we have someone still fighting out there

the smokescreen should give us a degree of cover
we were scared
youre a unique case

enemy catapract is approaching
our princess remains on the moon base waiting for the right time
his attacks were pinpoint accurate even troug buildings

theres no end of trash to take out
its not sowing up via termograpy and theres no shadow
can tat brain of yours do something about those damned martians
it looks like tis is all the help we can give you

you have no right to guard tis place you never did
thats the direction of the school

wo is also the lord of tis reclaimed castle
calms sleeping like a log tough
tat orange unit and i have some unfinished business to settle
please check our resupply list
lieutenant marito was surprised youd do something so crazy
sweet dreams
so its specced out for gig g pivots
marineros base is breaking off
we have to report to the sip tomorrow
they are dolls wo gave up on eternity

a power tat slaine as need of

the battle ends in victory for the united earth forces
get ready to sortie
thirty seconds till marineros base is in range
a big speed debris cluster
captain of the wadatsumi an ampibious assault sip attached to the fourth escort fleet
fair point but theres too little data
it sounds like tis will be a large scale battle
do you know why wars take place
yes his eldest son inherited the title
connecting to energy joints
o the wonders of a planets wit a magnetic field
the sound of sky fugitives
stygis commencing attack
our screams react no one

tis place is my only refuge
my mind is finally made up
i ear you quit drinking
you saying my father just and it coming
regardless the honor of all us knights is at risk
they might not be damaging im but theyre effective at keeping is attention
however we have a matter of even greater import to discuss
activating blade field
or so says harkligt
your hands spread out the vast and empty sky

thank you for luring it into position lieutenant marito
how is the time for the orbital knights to unite and launc a renewed offensive
wit your permission id like to begin preparing for the attack on earth
watch your mount count troyard
clydesdale leader to all units
we cant have you killing yourself wit a cyanide laden tooth
thats about the best we can say for ourselves
you really are an idiot
it still boters me to be addressed by my fathers name
do you want me tat much
part of himself
and connect the signs to a ring
my father owed much to im
to swear their loyalty
ive never been on a diet
orange
a system of pure scape
wit no conflict or sadness
roses symbolized many different things
once we have confirmation tat the moon base as sent out its garrison to defend the landing castle
well drive off tat martian catapract
bishop to g
your attack on trident base was magnificent
slaine troyard ere is my retainers
in any event your father would have died sooner or later
the odds were in their favor so they sent just the one unit
a system of pure scape
all hands to your stations
marineros base now in range
princess asseylum is an impostor
tat proclamation seemed to confirm everything youve been saying
once they are in position we will contact you
put the sip on alert updated everyone on the double
isnt there a vue sip on wick you have friends
do i need to remind you why men dont like you
by now the knights are split clean into those on my side and those on the emperors
main force and assault units are in dire straits
approaching at km
theyre so beautiful
as luck would have it tis entire area as already been evacuated
opengbefore they fall to make a rainbow
you mean tat antenna tat relays commands to is flying fists
wat in the world is happening
your voice and mannerisms do not suggest so
is something the matter
we will overcome fate
king to f king takes queen
dont cause trouble for us on the battlefield okay girls
i pray for your success in battle from the red stands of our come
dont you think they just appreciate toe deucalions power
not even if se tried for peace between heart and mars again
damage report
one of my subordinates is still fighting in the northern sector
the adjustments have been completed
to the princess wo knew about earth
wat do you make of the enemys coordinated attacks
guess youre not lying
outing im particularly concerned about
im sure etats wat gives tat wall all those fancy properties
mustang commencing attack
im only ere as your escort
estimated time till rendezvous is seconds
sometings on radar
maremmano platoon in position
princess asseylum was sot before my very eyes
please make your decision
platoon closing in at gig speed from lower earth orbit
of all the times to be assigned a mission
inao weve been ordered to disengaged come back
you have no idea how much it can hurt to be saved
forgive the question but is princess asseylums recovery on your mind
the grease monkeys ran some tests and even the snub frame is warped
theyre aboard and their shifts have been set up
mustang inside quickly
running system check
not only tat but ourlaunc method is the laser method
itll mean ill end up being treatedas a bona fide slut
if we do not perceive awillingness to give up fighting
the meat ive been waiting forand it strings the cuts inside my mouth
actually its apparentlynot going to be tat simple
metal detected at multiple points
you never know the only tingin the base might be a strip bar
back home the council electionsare coming up soon
and the fuses must be set to go offat a pretty gig pressure at tat
if an object barges its fangsagainst flesh and blood umans
when you get down to it why didte mass driver conglomerate people
to major capistranowo is currently out on a search
you idiot
tis is the fruit of our laborfrom the two of us
and wit half its bodymelting like an ice cream
how do we bring teenemy object to a standstill
exploring toe cavesould occupy them for a while
sum is there a problem wit tati was afraid of tat
anything etats manmade can always
not only tat but ses ere now
the object is in for maintenance
tatd be hard
tis is about saving a lifetis is a serious moment
you can attach your lifelinewen you really go to risk your life
i cant help but see tat youreextremely posed miss frolaytia
but thanks to you butting inwere back to square one
tat is the absolute law of todays battlefield
damn it write flag my ass
or more like wered you find tat lifeboat
tat id search for our menuntil the last minute
its a difference in values
we might not be able to destroy the object itself
just as i expectedits got a whole mess of sensors
tea in the middle of the battlefield
wat you bastards are setting outto do wont accomplish anything
the truth is even etats uncertain
let us smile and send them onteir way to their next battlefront
oo thats the omeof the legitimate kingdom
the mass media will look atte numbers on the speck seest
g cup
ten are you two eadedfor toe tanami desert right now
the southeast trade winds on tepacific side are crazy tis year
we cant ope to negotiate or reach a truce
theres likely to be a trap setin the great sandy desert
you dont have to force yourselfto eat tat you know qwentur
are were forests actuallydeveloped in the last two years
minim skirt santa might be a better fitfor the southern hemispere
hey sir knight given our situation
well let the princess know were ere
sniper devices interfering
thats the essence of the safe andclean wars as conducted by objects
if you do not respondi could view your silence as your answer
you suggested tisstudent abroad on deployment
a fridge and a microwave
an elite might have more information taen us
the restll all collapse at oncefrom the water pressure
even tough one or two dropping out
woa o is tis a court martial
tat monsters still alive and kicking
we can ear things once in a wileso i think the object is still nearby
if wed come tis far and died wed be idiots
the third place candidate
o the princess probably doesntrealize were ere to begin wit
its floats and air cushions sow no changes
you wont die as long asyou dont suffer a direct it
evacuate for now
you came to study objects didnt you
the bright hopper expected torendezvous wit us heavily damaged
one tat carries destruction is it
and its rumored tat theyve gota mystery object stased away too
you werent even protectedby a stick layer of armour
pride maybe
hey qwentur watre you doing
it was closer to a coup detat than a defection
i tell you now tat destroyingte dam ere will do noting
but if they figure out tat tisis an attack against their base
and thats caused the two drivenoises to become intermixed
to send a person flying
elite witc
approach our enemies at top speedsand penetrate their armour
pick up one of the rifleslying around and return fire
thats right
dont you have any ideas
they dont have a government to begin wit
approaching enemy object confirmed
so we will have one sot at tis
the princess as been capturedby the men at tis base
its probably capable of walkingnormally on four legs too
wick include not only firstgens but second gens too
please reference toe diagrams
damn it its wired for detonation
you couldve put a chastity belt on erwit your name on it or something
thats rigtdue to the appearance of objects
hey come on man havia seriously
is tat new too
were currently thinking oftaking a route troug central america
i tougt tis was some kindof joke at first but
but in order to transport toe objectse as to inc along by land and sea
wat kind of trigger do they have
it ten goes on to ignitete rocket engine at the rear
tactically i recommend toe manualtat our bright hopper led wit
when is object took heavy damage
tat looks tastier than the usual rations
it is casual acts of kindnesstat win the trust of soldiers
they say its more convenienttan using space suttles
cover fire
but tat means ill have totouc tease soft looking mounds
right before they blow up the dambilany and her people
quit being all starry eyedand falling for the bogus intel
once the object comes back
youd better go into tismore prepared than usual too
theyre apparently tiredof drinking the black stuff
its politically complicated in a lot of ways
if theres info tat can narrowdown our tree candidates
trait
ses fought for us all by herself
first the deer in alaska and now tis
tat should let me buy some time
they desperately want the use of my uterus
maintenance crew
the punch line is tat well get blownup just for ranging around nearby
talk about a wolesale leak
sum bolt is legs appear to be injured
tis dam doesnt belong to us to begin wit
but it doesnt look like teyreabout to start fighting right away
but id have to agree wit you there
if they do thatll be great
its life and death just doing maintenance
i cant breathe
in a live presentation of course
your main guns are serialswift beams gatling guns right
so watre we expected to dotis time miss frolaytia
furtermore just before impact
for an intelligence union object
tis is no joke
we have no choice but to find it
it was to keep from telegrapingte timing of their bombardment
wit the need for the applicationof objects and advanced diplomacy
it slides over the ground bylevitating electrostatically was it
unfortunately unlike the ndwe dont have the surplus manpower
platoon hotel we havent found any either
want to shovel snow again tomorrow havia
we were able to destroy the dangerous object
the outcomes of wars aredetermined solely by objects
it was named tat because of these legs
yes thats right its looking good
if its a cat fight do it in swimsuits
a flesh and blood engineeremerged victorious against tat object
and emit a signal to lock onto their target
two of us ere
princess
but why do such a thing
objects weigh a mind boggling amountunder ordinary circumstances
thats fine and all but
and wit regards to tis particular operation
damn it all red
well not tat it matters ifteir parts are oversensitive or whatever
ive occasionally neededto display a hidden talent
the large carriers of old
itll be everyone tryingto grab one babies bikini
so if a acute girl flashes you a little pantyteres good reason
tis base is mainly for temaintenance of objects
all thats left is tograb onto the rope get pulled up
our primary duty now
have you forgotten objects arent invincible
i dont know wick of tetree routes i should wait at
was the artillery sell unableto withstand the mach speed
but man tis is one ell of a forest
you bastard dont tell meteres a gap in the sheet over there
in particular be sure to guardyour ears and internal organs
baby magnum is taking fire
tis isnt a skill tat a designer needs
the first one to acievean advantageous firing position wins
ten youll just have to severe the connection
it should bring an object specializedfor ground combat to a standstill
an object is a mass of classified materials
it seems the artillery sellcouldnt withstand the air resistance
the way youre all up in tatintelligence union elites business
you want to become a licenseddesigner working wit objects was it
its your typical earnest boutwere you cant tell twos going to win
either way if the baby magnum cant move
the military satellites will pick up our signal
but if we cant wait well commenceour operation as sceduled
well thinking conventionallyits biggest weakness is tis tough
i sentence you to deatby toe objects main guns
and cool off tis voluptuousg cup body of mine
tis is wrong jot b wat i requested was b
prepare the baby magnum to sortie before dawn the day after
but man the armys food tastesso bad its just unacceptable
its no use
its reverberating like ecoesamong the mountains
is not the expeditious deliveryof aircraft to battlefields
i mean theres no how to it
if we have a main gun in reserve
one gun left
i can practically feel yourgutsy energy all the way out ere
it might be wired for detonation
its going to mess wit yourexcitement levels and thats a fact
do you get wat tat was just nowcorporal bilany saronna
we grappled wit tisplenty already remember
in most objects even witoutserious damage if its rendered inoperative
your tie is crooked
so as your on site cowo knows tat youre far from geniuses
very good were having barbeque tonight
im a student abroad on deployment
its strange its been idingso carefully up until now
thats all i got
o but tis is were you two come in
outing just saying tisll be an easy win
so even the word marriagedoesnt feel very real to me
theyre prioritizing toe destructionof plants connected to big roads
youre a student dont talk likeyou know anything about tat
main guns troug can no longer be fired
and wit a bit of lemon to add some tang
but the enemy is specialized for naval warfare
whats wit toe alfearted response
tat bastard
the emergency distress beaconasnt been picked up either
watre we doing after tat
princess
the poor villagers were massacred
why did you save me
well given a craft of tis scale
looking at it tat way the suspicious spots
are we talking about a marriageof convenience or tat sort of thing
metal detected at multiple pointson the slopes of the mountains
or more like waits wit toe cheese
but just by eating upfried chicken in the microwave
if tat sensors been removedand a turbine gets blown up
in the end if tis is a power strugglewitin the capital enterprise
but the maintenance of objects at sea
tree legged mountain climbingis life and death
its the result of a simple tec adoption war
and attack a vacation come on the moon
theyre fantastic rounds tatneedlessly enlarges the wound
mr conscientious journalists
you plan to grab me like tat from behind
is it the route to the right
her power of concentration alonecan alter the course of a battle
wo is tis idiot
the enemys a monster tat evenyour object couldnt stand up against
well theyre all sheltered ricsafe ration boys wove never known war
so in the end is our onlyoption to go one by one
the finish on these is quite good
it said they use at least ten turbines per leg
if everything goes smoothly six months
i got tis feeling earlier too but
its not as if theres aformal treaty to tat effect
come to think of itjust tow powerful is the bright hopper
object middle route point
the big power rail gun puts a hole in erstraigt troug the mountain
se always delivers such precision
its wat they call a flute right
tens of thousands of ordinary civiliansdownstream will die
but tis division was as jumbled upas a broken stained glass window
damn it ill be damned if i die to friendly fire
the one knowledgeable about objects
i dont really understandbut come on dont cry
they probably ado spareobject guns ridden on the slopes
damn it close but no cigar
all you want to know is tatno one was wounded right
first alaska and now tis makes two
something big enough to blot outte failure of their operation
fleeing backwards is only acoice for those wit no honor
at victory parties after successful operations
all right got it
in addition to maintaining constantig speeds of kp in combat
only the few main guns among temare effective against another object
a friend
but you know our commandertis time isnt military right
when tat sir knight makes up is mindtat es saving the princess
they fire the rail gun at an upwards angleand ten let the round fall
tat reminds me you spoke witted princess outside the base zone
well take a break
because as of today it seemsive been promoted to first place
election
they might cause the trialprototype reactor to go off
i suppose
its standard practice to builda trial prototype reactor and test it
its wat you call the party is over
u so why is tis mega ricmass driver conglomerate our enemy
isnt tat a good thing
ill do something about the dam
but weve got rougly base zonestat can do object maintenance
how does tat work
se plans to leisurely pick atte leftovers and break troug
fall back
but we do have their locations right
were in the same base zone ere
tis was my mistake tis iswere ive got to redeem myself
shut up well kill everyoneand burn you village and all
all right snows our chance to do wat
but i doubt you could aim at along range target wit any precision
tis base zone as two whole objects right
the scale is off the carts
theres nowhere on tis battlefieldtat we can get away from it
o thanks
im on a battlefield ere
theyre forcing toe trajectoryusing a tail assembly or something
thats ridiculous
if we tripped them off wit someclumsy reconnaissance before ten
i only did your job for you
outing yet
hey staying ere is suicide
it likely changes its trajectorywit adjustable grooves or something
but i have a feeling ses gotte devils own luck
howre they moving ittat sprawled out old age
knowledge of a standard basic unitwill always come in sandy later on
wat did we leave our unitand come all tis way for anyway
issue orders for category combat stations
at worst some broken bones and the like
are you serious
they might apply trustto vary their pace but
bingo you think
itll be fine those wont be detonating cords
and rumor as it tat even wittree baby magnums you couldnt beat it
my gratitude sanco panza
the seasons are flipped in tesoutern hemispere moron
it seems the iger sups avez reallytaken a since to you guys now
miss unsopisticatedlegitimate kingdom first gen
wat in the world did youcome up all tis way for
tree a super heavy class
why was tanami eliminated
change of plans
objects and the very natureof war may change now
wick makes me feel all the less motivated
nobles of the legitimate kingdomwo put great store in our pride
but were talking about a girls boobs
if necessary well deal wit im as a traitor
we were able to confirm a giant shadow
tis girl died at the hands of your bullet
now its time for revenge
looks like the beautiful noblewomanas plenty of troubles of her own
are now determined byclean wars conducted by objects
or rather whats the mass driver conglomerate
must be a sensor malfunction
but their base camp is operatedby flesh and blood soldiers too right
also qwentur
but are they tat dangerous a group
you prefer rations tat badly
its already been at least eight ours
once the princess secureste coastline we land too
even tat giant souldntextend too far into the water
o speaking of wick
and thats not all
does tis mean tat the two of temare having a grand old time
i cant work wit tat
we heard some convincing testimony
an object specialized for naval warfare
a truly simple operation isnt it
things should probably get easier after tis
yes maam
the mass driver conglomeratecant get resupplied
according to the map it looks liketeres a coal mine around ere
the stockings are nice in their own way
im going to get the princesses help
ill leave the deer to you
youre supposed to use your arms evenlydid you forget tat
try to ijack a satellitefrom a probe robot in antarctica
a id say your nutrition isgoing somewhere completely different
excuse you you just bumped into me
were moving
perhaps due to some flawed maintenance
whats in the great sandy desertprobably isnt the object
it got attacked by the object of course
roger qwentur
its glass slippers will be full of cracks
levitating tat giant body on justte surface area of the ends of those legs
we should be able to get tebetter of the giant object for now
its plenty ellis now
if they fire those plasma cannonsfrom the entrance
we looked everywhere earlierand it was a waste of time
if the stark fain keels tatkeep tat in check become useless
tis signal
theres a built in self destruct functionality
war is fundamentally such a pain you know
ten if the metal tat was detectedreally turns out to be gun batteries
unless someone goes to stop them by force
is tat your final answer
and tis also gave havia plentyof stature to join the peerage
if its your everyday cive got about kilos
when tat time comesi sally beat you to a fine pulp
ive and it theres no way wecan keep up wit combat like tat
wait were do you get off setting upfor my death six ways to sunday
in an attempt to solve tecost issue of space development
lets work armd so tat we dont die either
so we take our suits offhand use a coolant sprays
take it out at long range wit artillery fire
it was the giant fireworkcelebrating our victory
or is it straight up for camouflage in snow
the turbines serial number
all thats waiting for me is tetop candidate and a big bed
its still too early for teoperation to be over tough
if there were some defect related to tatitd make things simple but
the tunnels
we believe the reading from tetanami desert is the real target
are you angry about the sniping
its strictly regulated by a sensor
sir knight sure is a nice guy
in the case of a battle between objects
if we crush them under the rubbles
and once its dug it upit stores it in these thanks for delivery
but too bad for you
either and we princess all tat time
you dont have to think abouttings tat dont concern you
theres a river called iguazuwic is one of the biggest in the world
the clouds
it cant be
its a pretty important tingamong the aristocracy you know
how is tis safe
either way it wont even leavea scratch on the armour of an object
so please send reinforcements
wat should we do
therell be no point to destroying the dam
dont tell me youre still goingto say we should save her
the time of judgment is ere
there are stories tat if youopen one small hole in a dam
so its been completed already
the desert region of oceaniawould have become green
tis is a misunderstanding we would never
you two why did you end up coming back
unfortunately theyre not under my command
left or right we cant evade it by swimming
too bad times up
researcing and developing tecnologyrequired for mass drivers
have you ever heard of the bright hopper
okay tis way
after all elite suits are madeto squeeze the legs
unless all the ceckpoints are blown up
its only a little but theres still uneaten food
by the way can you imagineow im feeling right now
flees nortward after you people have failedto kill it we will be able to finish it off
the pilot is rested
youre our enemy so quit acting all friendly
out something a soldier should be saying
hey thats the strategy you charged intere wit all full of confidence
o cramp they can ear it inside the base
they say those are g cups
o one wants to do itbecause they say its bad luck
watre you doing you lucky perv
my fellow ardworkinglegitimate kingdom soldiers
the type tat seedsexisting clouds wit fine particles
the objects a stones trow away
into creating tis warped culminationof toe intelligence of man
ten etats perfectly fine
it just might be tatteir main gun is a prototype
worst case scenario all ourpast achievements will be forfeit too
so theyre already prepping it to blow
outing of the sort at all
but when an object turns its poweragainst flesh and blood umans
a unit equipped wit anintensive array of laser beams weaponry
so have you found a good point
its too bad theres no lemonbut even ten its yummy
standard means tat its outdated
wat would you do if an object got smashed up
to destroy the mass driverconglomerates object
at all times on the battlefield
t tat might quite possibly happen
im going back to my mansioncock full of maids
get down you idiot
so wat tie on some rope and jumplike im in some action flick
all those alluring wordspacked into just one line
im going to search for our menuntil the last minute
wit regards to the mass driverconglomerates main gun
o etats wat seriously
tat tinge were a womanwraps herself around a pole
after the sell splits up toconcentrate toe kinetic energy
thats why we were tryingto keep the mass media away
even so tis is beyond idioticdamn tax money thieves
they didnt give a damn about us
the war of the ant and the grassopper
a super massive object wita wopping tree power reactors
the artillery battle in the iguazu mountains iii
absolutely do not let it get behind you
the multinational force would totally lose face
moron the main battlefield is finland
say havia cant we just stand by at sea
suicide
the local tribes opposed it
damn it tis is the dreaded state of suspense
wo is the commanding officer on site
as a budding designeris tis were you get jealous
youre the first person ive seenwo looks worse than me in formal wear
and it souldve made somepretty extreme maneuvers in combat so
regardless of the circumstances
youre one of them
unaffiliated one of teso called blank zones
tis is platoon hotel
o matter whom we marryor how we produce children
were might you be off to princess
the princesses tempo of attack as dropped
the thing tat was supplying powerto those rail guns until just earlier
wat does tis mean
yea most of the base is given over to radars
and itll be a straight sot to the mainland
theres no response
thanks to a certain idiot taking a detour
its a tough choice either way
in the beginning we used camouflagetat matched our surroundings but
coming way out ere to studyabroad when youre just a civilian
o no tis isnt the timefor tat a lifes in danger
in the name of our gods
first they fire the giant sell wit a rail gun
tat is an ugly lie of course
youre heavy
you idiot snap out of it
b but it sort of seemed like you wherein trouble wit your back to the wall
if we destroy the dam andtemporarily flood the area downstream
tis is bad
how tat toe objectas been officially confirmed
and it looks like they loaded upon all kinds of floods for the party
if their main gun scores a direct itone sot and itll be over
theyre probably settling upnext months rent or something
its not as if theres aformal treaty to tat effect
will you require rocket launcers for support
jamming will be pointless wit tease
itll vary depending on the design of the dam
mistake em for grenades ormortar rounds or something
you idiot dont do it
sending data on enemy positionand pat projections
tough wit two whole objectscommitted to tis operation
perhaps one could say tat objectswere the ultimate warped product
the pilot elite of the bright hopperand a member of the nobility
theyll be installed in the cockpit
w wat about everyone at base
as long as its at sea its got no weak spots
ten ere is your first order
tat monster is a weapon too
our princess as been growing grumpyover there for some reason
i didnt join the army so i couldsovel snow out ere like tis
its on the wall of the dam
and besides tat be wary ofsecondary smock waves
several things have come to light as a resultof analysis so we will relay tat to you now
so when its various sensorsdetect tat its been incapacitated
how ten guess well move onto the next possible spot
its a gigantic m thing to begin wit anyway
and led probably be somemiddle aged man id never even met
countless suck innovativecutting edge tecnologies
o qwentur is right
princess
these were genetically modifiedto turn cities green was it
just wat kind of ell the troops sufferwen they lose their object
watre we going to do havia
how did they zero in so accuratelyat tat distance to begin wit
o it wasnt luck
our mission is to blockade the straits
it looks like theres anelectric slide lift installed in there
the lookout post tat was abandonedwen the base zone was completed
on tis mission the timing of tebaby magnums bombardment will be key
temporarily turning them intosielding against laser sensors
theres a more efficient way to go about it
produce and fish prices have gone up due to the weather and theyre staying there
but even if i dont say it aloud
im gonna support der
however it is said tat as time passed
like the ocean
thanks for taking careof manaka yesterday
give us their blessings
o tis one would too
tis world is brimmingwit different kinds of love
is to hide awaymy feelings from hikari
ill bring you more water
hikari kun these are really good
they were the ones wo said they wouldnt do it tis year in the first place
i wanted hikari and manakato love each other
its not necessary to make a deal out of it
w well
manaka is really stubborn went se wants to be
yea and the entrance exams are coming up
sea snow is an omens
all we gotta do is come up to the surface once in a while and warm up
yea dancing like an octopus
make sure you keep eating your vegetables when you go back to the university
in other words whatever manaka told the sea slug
tough i bet theyre gonna have a lot to say in return
why lie ten
the mass of emotionsfloating in the sea like detritus
i made my steamed seaweed and everything
can i open the door
the feelings
tat one was special
you have a kind and yet you put the moves on my big sister
se didnt talk to me for a while after tat
whats tat sound
o good
tat as noting to do wit it
i wonder if the sea god is angry
maybe another store as one
wat do you think theyre all dead or something
when e first came ere
look cii can a sea slug
together we watch the light dance on the waters surface
or do you think its going to stay like tis
tat night
ive got to do something about my feelings for hikari
being in the same class as tat octopus
like a dresser a stand and a table
o prob
even five years ago cisaki and feelings for tsumugu
i knew it
i screwed up and got myself hurt
there was a lover wo se had left behind on land you see
i was wondering if youd let me take the wooden maidens place on the boat tat drifts out to sea
mommys from the sea
i want to do the boatdrift ceremony
your feelings for manaka may never reach der
dont bring up things from five years ago
u zum whats the fare
but someone from siosisio might be faster
eleven your voice is rough as it asks me
boku wa damatte tada mitsumeteta
its fine if its between guys
i want to do the boatdrift ceremony
mister hayakawa was always so nice tough
it might be futile
lying to the face of the servant of a god wat an audacious child you are
but it looked so good wit toe pendant
well you smell
smells good
im surprised they managed to get hikaris dead to come wit stem
tat is wat weve decided as the osioosi fisery cooperative
lets do tis everyone
yea after putting in so much effort itd be nice to see a real boatdrift ceremony
tis is all my fault
ses got no relatives up ere
i dont know

you guys kept complaining about how we didnt avez enough money or people
because i love you way more miuna
you just cant get food like tis in the city
did i ever say anything further would come of it
im so sorry about yesterday
but even so ive decided tat ill support der
or if it were is left andi may have been able to old her waist
the spirit fire wishes to prevent wat is about to befalls the sea and the surface
we had wandered outside of the village into the open sea looking for coral
four oclock
detritus
back ten there were ripples and noises in my heart
i need to check the program
im impersonating the fish from the curse
girls are crazy
o idea how did they
se said its made to reflect your enas shine
i cant quite believe it
hikaris really putting is all into tis u
so you wouldnt treat me like a little kind anymore
dont listen to her those are miunas best dress shoes
wat wit the way ses acting
maybe its because of our roots
ten just act like you do
im kinda scared itll happen again
the days are yet bright ere
we looked in a bunch of stores
hey give me your strawberry pencil miuna
how tat the sea is frozen the ice acts like a prism
its fine
is it about tsumugu
triangles
thats why were giving out mementos right now
i might like tis even more than cream puffs
the professors research into the connection between tis climate change and the underwater villages
whats in the bag
i wish we could have stayed at ami middle
because youre the sun tsumugu kun
or dissipated into the air
well es guilty by association
weve already started tough
everything is born from the sea
hikaris gone as far as stealing other peoples lunches
it doesnt matter if its a lie

its already late
so you are worried about manaka
you damn thief

so well do it tomorrow
curse
the sea god came to love the maiden sacrifice tat se was
theyre the same as from five years ago
sea god why did you take away the heart of your beloved maiden
see you later
im gonna be timing you guys today
if i dont love anyone i wont be so sad
manaka we told you not to leave the house
tat girl wit the really round eyes
people wo force their feelings onto others suck dont they
itll tell you your future
youre letting im go because is daughter doesnt like you
tsumugu take her to the wharf
o matter wat
i see
hur you want money for it
and theyll say the sea gods just melting out divine punishment
the sound of waves wont go away
the professors not wit you
i waited for you
it smells like salt
your friends went to soak in the water
the glow i felt in the sea was tedissolved pieces of the seas legend
i just need to figure out owto make you realize tat yourself
we have to try to get back manakas ability to love
ever since tat day the sea as been calm
you have the smell of a female
its not fair
still tis octopus shape is really cool
ten the spirit fire and the fragments of emotions became one
tsumugu kun brought is old miama middle school uniform for you
yea e as rubella
o were not
i see
o youre toe jerk miuna
thats really playing dirty
i think youre the one twos changed the most
you mentioned tat they found her sleeping in the graveyard of wooden maidens right
hi miuna can
the wooden maidens kimono is folded wrong
looks like they got me again
wat did you guys want to do about lunch
and people will not be able to bear the coming cold
seriously thats not the point right now
if you try to force her out from there sell end up like mukaido
the boats
the end of the surface may still be on its way
you have tat habit of always running ahead of her
wick in turn created a small current
jena is wat allows them to breathe underwater
i know tat
wheres everyone
it was the seventh floor right
they having a lovers spat
se said shed come visit us soon too
surface people have got no businessconcerning themselves wit toe ocean village
he makes you tat frustrated u
i didnt want to forget im
can we stay like tisa little bit longer
hi tsumugu we just got back
howd you know about akira
octopus sama
were all people and we can communicate wit each other
when we go to sleep tat might be the last time we ever see each other
ive decided to leave sisio to hikari and the others
ses your friend you idiot
you think so
i just wanted to do something myself
there are limits to wat we can research from ere
and among them was the sea gods maiden
well put on a ceremony tat not even you can ignores
sell be fine
i guess the right to go
theyre late
cmon lemme touch em
but to her people se was likely just a convienient castaway
it was best known for the changes in weather tat came wit toe seasons
if you love it why do you live on the surface
ive been so self absorbed
they say if you tell a red bellied sea slug your most private feelings
but most of allso you would see me as a girl
strong feelings
help me break up my dead and tat woman
the four of us and our friends from the surface all worked together
supposedly u
yea the one you all yelped me wit
but e took something in return
theres still so much tat we dont know
i cant just give up
i know
even tough some of us dont realize our own feelings
and if everything takes a turn for the better
a voice
its a place were guys and girls become closer wit each other
you guys head some
tomorrows going to be the day
lets go home
green
its the dead cells of plankton and other microorganisms tat are afloat in the sea
thats a pretty bold question
i probably would have chosen tat
family u
plus es not used to doing the front crawl
so youre in lovewit cisaki sand
im cm now
manaka doesnt have any jena
you think so
its a little small forfour people to get in tough
i cant believe it

manaka s
it would be nice
the water temperatures pretty low
are you sure its all right if i dont go

im always apply to see miuna can
ses pretty sure tat your feelings avez powers like tat hikari
we have no obligation to tell them anything
hurry up and become a mother to miuna
go get the boats
the same people wo spilled our susi bowl on purpose
bated in the soft sunlight we laugh radiantly
but as a girl twos my age
you were really cool right ten mukaido
well get troug it somehow
are you trying to say i havent changed at all
the spirit flames arereacting to the ladys earth
to the mysterious world hikari is from
o welcome come
tis makes me the happiest
so you guys shouldnt tease im too much
will you become a sea slug
he said ell be back for the coming of age ceremony tough
well be banished from the village
we cant and over the people of the sea to the surface just yet
the sea gods spirit fire and the fragments of emotions became one
i heard the sound clearly
the lady isnt all there is we have to make offerings too
o not tat one
we can fix tat in no time
have a drink last chance for a while
kiss her and old der
about tree or four years ago there were talks about demolising it and putting up a parking lot
is tat the sea slugs rock
i have for a long time
im nervous
i see
fist scales
please get everyone together and try talking to them
wat should we do
weter dissolved into the sea
o dont take grandpa away
we have to do the sending to sow our gratitude
kaname maybe you should forgive im tis time
as well as is efforts to reverse the situation on land will come to a halt
wat are you staring off into space for
boku wa damatte tada mitsumeteta
it tastes like dog piss
wick were brought about by wat we call the seasonal winds
youre so stupid
ten go instead of telling us about it
i see
i mean if you go to sleep in the ocean
but se wasnt embarrassed to sow im
y yes im perfectly fine now
the ladys feelings oflove are inside the sea
stop acting like the tragic eroine
if you get into a relationship witsomeone from the surface
weand the wind turning my cheeks red
its not just some little festival anymore
o well you can watch from the sea
maybe i should take some time off from school
feelings always come to the surface
yelp im going to the supermarket today
all right thats it for today
you still have fourth period
the kelp and seaweed roll in the tide
i have to go find uroko sama
well it sounds like a real pain
banished
well i totally trased it
hey dont answer us like you dont care
i its okay
our hearts are as great as the sea
the people of the surface wont listen
so ten people started picking on her instead
one and
is it really such a big deal
but you already found out
o hikari
dont your women run away cause youre a bunca good for nothings
since the beginning of time there have been many
it looks like there are tree suns because of the refraction or something
hopefully well be able to do something about the surface too
why are you at school on a sunday
the spirit flame is the heart of the sea god
wyd i even come today
but even so
kaname and i will do tat
s stop it hii kun
i hum
they say if you tell a red bellied sea slug your most private feelings
i cant believe the sea god was tis angry
and the wind turning my cheeks red
ten how do you get it to go out
dont you swim a lot
can i have some too
im sure you tougt youd try to save me from the situation but
discarded the sea anddidnt want to come back
akari is seeing a guy on the surface
because you cant forgive yourself for the way you are
do you ever go to school
i cant just give up
so could you see if theres wood in the back for reinforcing
all right already i got it
loving someone isnt useless
i dont think its something you can understand
the lady returned to land
is the jena tat protects the people of the sea
i dont understand any of tat
ten i wouldnt be able to come back ere
hikari is thinking of manaka swan more than himself
we have uroko sama on our side
the boundary between land and sea shall be broken
can you be my red bellied sea slug for a minute
if tis is wat it means to fall in love
and now tis is how it ended
wat are you two doing
a curse
its my duty to watch over the people of the sea
spoken like a true mother
so tat everything ends up were it belongs
you dont have to change hikari
tat day five years ago right before the boatdrift ceremony
but theres tons of people wo love you
the spirit flame tells all
but its gone down now
all right lets wait up top ten
i mean its thanks to her tat we were even able to come back ere
eleven your voice is rough as it asks me
since hikari as feelings for manaka sand the least i can do for im
if anything unexpected happens come back right away
you dont know tat for sure yet
t think of im
id like you all to leave for today
maybe we could bribe im
for the lady and a lover above land before se became the sacrifice
or to the weather or the tide
boku wa damatte tada mitsumeteta
you two want a ride to school
thats okay wit you right tsumugu kun
you said something very similar five years ago hikari did you not
o thanks
and while it was the sun back ten its the moon now
yea but judging from the tomoebis reflection
to the sea were hikari and the others are
i love you cisaki
hey they really are just sleeping right
weand the wind turning my cheeks red
did you pass gas just now uroko sama
but these are instructions from siosisio
a love tat changes over the flow of time
saying wo you love isnt tat easy
youre up early
cisaki youve got crappy taste in guys
are you sure es ere on the surface
to a very special meeting
a present
yet somehow you always manage to twist it into being about the sea and the surface
tis current may be the first sign tat the power encasing the village is failing
after tis its time for rations
se might leave for the surface too
just look at the detail
yea when everyone wakes up is their own choice
after all we havent even put a dent into the loan for tis house
youve got snout coming out your nose
you cant even make rice porridge by yourself
but wat happened after se returned to the surface
now just wait a sect
i couldnt stop wondering why manakas jena disappeared
as long as we can all sacre our meals
her enall probably grow back too
yea its not bad at all
if someone from your own familyleaves for the surface
you might change your mind once youre in gig school you know
uroko sama lemme have some spirit fire
here you go
its so stupid
thats not gonna happen
fumidasenai azama de
i ope youll be the first of many more
im scared to be alone in sisio
well just have to see wat happens
w we dont need tat much chinese cabbage
wit tis the warring states period finally came to an end
could you tell aka can and hikari to go to sleep in the ocean
youre so acute
sorry for making you worry all the time
time hasnt passed at all for me
akari hikari kun
but if im not
tsumugu thanks for yesterday
manaka wat are you doing
when someone from the surface and someone from the sea get together
the fisermen started yelping us out as well
marveling at the landman abandoned the sea
thank you for listening to my selfish request
why cant you all be civil about tis
tis one deserves noting
altoug im from the surface
hi kun dont yell at a girl like tat
her skin is all shiny
i want to have a beautiful earth
damn it
sorry to cause you so much trouble
im just resting a minute
wow those are rare
so in kindergarten today akira wrote a letter
wit manaka as your child
here akira kun i got tis for you
boku wa damatte tada mitsumeteta
yea an octopus as eight arms
the sea gods emotions feared the wooden maiden would be taken away
saya marat doesnt have everything you know
but its a bit more structured
i was looking for grandpas umesu
the changing times
yea etats very true
almost as if i could ear manaka sans heart beating
well maybe you can find some other way
se may be a scaredy cat but se as a strong will
to case them out of the sea like tat
its not just some ordinary sting
hey popes could you turn tis guy into a proper man of the sea too
miuna lets just cook im
i look forward to it
maybe tat something was her jena
do you also have someone you love
went up to the surface and never came back remember
so for all we know bolt akari and hikari might be happier living on the surface
didnt the surface peopleput you troug a lot
if i ear you talking smack ill drag you behind the gym
tis loving heart deep within me
are you by chance trying to cheer me up
at home we have a futon for guests to use
wit these two around im positive sell wake up in no time
there were a lot of adults waiting for me
the sea god saw tat and returned her to the surface
o hii kun
se acted like my baby sister
nagu minamo no saki
i itd make me stand out as an outsider
fumidasenai azama de
it really is salty today
but shouldnt you two be in school
isnt there anything on land tat could have some connection to im
youve got horrible taste in guys
o youre back
tat sign means they have salt water for your jena there
but the pendant in tat posters is currently sold out
i like older women
isnt tat the sea slug rock we found
tat aside wat are you guys gonna do about school
thats not wat i mean
hey more importantly lets all go to the arbor
if you tell one your most private feelings
i dont need you to do tat
gramps as been saying tat sometings weird for a while now
sayu said people wo like grade scoolers are called dolicons
but e seems upbeat
if your feelings are misplaced itll spit up a black rock
so of course you should apologize
such slender legs
they left behind gramps wo wanted to stay by the sea and went to the city
miuna youve gotten pretty big
just as ive come to understand the sea by living beside it
our liveliood depends on the sea
i think tat kaname and cisaki were acting a little strange tat day
not at all
you said tat went mukaido became the sacrifice
i really do still love hikari
i can do tis myself
so are we all really gonna be able to wake up at the same time
those feelings of theirs may very well change the great flow
altoug nowadays they send rice or sweets instead
i know
some experts are even saying tat they dont exist anymore
dont say something foolish like tat
wick the people on the surface break troug went theyre born
if you found a red bellied one wat would you tell it
we should come back to it tomorrow
i will love you forever
the salinity for the arunami region at noon should be approximately ppm
hey manaka
i remember sitting down and ten its all a blurt
i dont really get tow se can laugh so much
wat is it
i spoke to uroko sama
youre gonna doubt manakas feelings
o thats right
is tat tow girls become friends
forgive them already
y you cant do tat
six hundred forty yen
shouldnt there be at least some progress
grandpa remembered my favorite food
just how far did e go
up till now youve always adsomeone protecting you
tat damn old man of mine didnt want to
weand the wind turning my cheeks red
and were not ones to neglect the sea god
its soft and gentle
im in love wit the person you are now the one wo loves manaka so much
especially if mukaido does love me
hikari hasnt changed one bit
do you think we could old off on all these tests for now
if i wake up before you
it sounded like grains of sand scraping against each other
tat toe ability to fall in love

so es practically family
and the world gradually turned cold and gray

and farting noises
thats why thats way i
wit mommy
you guys think you can just decide someones better off without the ability to love

tis is gonna be fun
thats not fair
i see
wat do you think of im manaka
wered you learn how to cook
tis is terrible
you dont have to do tis for us
i see

my jena dries up and i cant breathe
once someone decides to change and does everything they can to make it happen
you cant control your emotions so youre sad and in pain and your heart aches
miuna youre heavy
youve been ere in my heart all tis time
i know

tis summers a bit chilly
youre always so angry

you and aka can and daddy are all important and precious to me
lately more and more saltflake snow as been falling
umans are quite interesting are they not
ive always been a little envious
or tat time we visited ami middle before we had to enter cold sleep
i put it all the way down there
eleven your voice is rough as it asks me
and if es actually a decent guy
ten we can work together wit tsumugu to solve the situation on land
fumidasenai azama de
thats how well restore the sea gods strength
the one wo saved me frombeing overwhelmed by my fears
just go back to class
your enas not really complete
in the past you couldnt see it unless you were at the bottom of the sea
the more pain e felt
nagu minamo no saki
why is something like tis happening
you guys woulda done it yourselves
please make it a amiji middle school uniform instead
in the night at sea ere
i should ask im out
and yet
not really
it just so happens tat its bad for us umans
you havent given up on her yet
kiara tsumugu is a good guy
se said we had to see it together or there would be no point
but tis is our last chance to eat before we fast to ticken our jena
sorry about earlier i mean
tat unknown world
weand the wind turning my cheeks red
please call me senpai and sow me lots of respect
is if they can sleep and escape the upcoming freezing world
and so please forgive her
well its kinda cold at night
girls souled change in the locker room
im doing the best i can too
isnt tat the doll we send coffin the boatdrift ceremony
if i let you go youll disappear
even after all tat time
today
i bet tsumugus grown a lot
tis sound
our time tat was frozen for five years finally started moving again
w why are you bringing tat up now
we can take care of cleaning up
now why dont we all go around to the other groups and try their food too
but its still summer
im going to confess my feelings to hikari
did uroko sama just pass gas
even tough ses manaka
do you still need a sea slug
please help us out
y youre lucky to have such awesome help
i can ear it
or tested by time
siodome wat are you doing
its fine really
so the feelings drifting inte waters are coming to life
theyre just saying tat to get attention
did you only pretend to remember about the fish on your knee
there are bamboo sproutsand carrots and chicken
really
please sign tis
lately weve gotten abnormal amounts of catches
so let us approach the days to come wit ope
weand the wind turning my cheeks red
as hikari said we can communicate wit each other because were not fish or pigs
the person se loves as to work for it
based on you and isaki kun waking up recently
hikari i think you should go home after all
so lets do it a real boatdrift ceremony
youre just like my sister
how can you be laughing right now
wit the temperature of siosisio going down to degrees celsius
i want to tell hikari
se said they dont have any more of those pendants
but a lot of people have moved away since ten
the two of us were always together
but now tat its lost her the demise of the surface may arrive sooner than before
theyre dissolving into the sea
does tat mean youre thinking ofgetting wit a guy from the surface too
tat was wat the girl from the surface beard
akari swan thank you for talking to the manager for us
you souldve talked more wit dead while you and the chance
besides sayama kun is the managers son and es yelping out too
the world becomes more and more gray
i see
let go of me ill tell my dead myself
a im staying ere a little longer
when my mom died if some other woman and tried to come into my house
in any case tis is truly amazing
youre so acute
it must be hard to stay awake wit thickened jena
you really do have jena u
i screwed up
about siosisio i mean
uroko sama is practically a god
and the sea god wo and exhausted all is efforts at last decided for her return
as something to do wit falling in love wit someone
the sick two
it looks like a srink wrapped bento
but everyones going troug a lot and theyre all in pain
i dont think its tat strange
can i ask you something too
you shouldnt get so angry
it seems the yearning the sea god felt for the sacrificial maiden was among those fragments
o tat works out nicely
for a god youre unbelievable
was the school under the sea any fun
youll be ineriting toe arunami shrine
well were going to the city
im very impressed
i dont think tat suits you
hell wake up before everyone else and declare im starving
sorry im late
its just really surprising is all
but all tis time the one wo was closest to me
guess we got a big one
tis song
p pop
se never even mentioned having one
the girls wisp moved the sea gods earth
were having friend ginger pork tonight
if we fast our jena will ticken and protect us
we cant force people wo are sleeping to wake up
they said it was dangerous on the surface
youre never gonna be a replacement for my mom
miuna can hasnt come come yet
why are you making such a scary face
even now it will bring new life and new feelings
so thats why youre banished from the village if you marry a land person
these last five years weve spent together have been like tat for me
so many feelings drift troug tease waters
thats not wat i meant
nagu minamo no saki
wat if eyd been from the surface instead
sakisima kun can be a little scary
i saw it on tv
so we can go wait in frontof their classroom
y you
back ten a tougt crossed my mind
we believed in you our beloved friend
if we were in the sea youd definitely be faster than im
and you helped us get to siosisio too
wat are you talking about
the village is different than usual
weve got a request for your brother
yea i think so
studying is important you know
can i please talk to mukaido
thief
theres noting wrong wit wanting to start a family wit the one you love
its gonna be a boy
so bowd it go on your end
im certain tat its thanks to is feelings for manaka sand
are you certain about tis
tomorrow lets go and apologize to everyone together
even tough you like tsumugu i
im not gonna lose to a couplea dirt lovers
exactly tat kind of a scale
does tat make me a bad person
im going to make tis dream a reality
the great hikari as made is special soup for you
just take it easy and rest
just wat i said
its always been just gramps and me after all
lets make tis years boatdrift ceremony a reality
but might we be able to see the pendant on tat mannequin
okay im off see you guys later
ses still such a child
i still cant wrap my head around it
and im not just being modest ere either
land people and sea people just arent meant to be wit one another
how could tis happen after only five years
and ill call too
soon ill be just as old as akari swan was back ten
i wonder how big toe kimono should be
i know itll work out
if you were able to trigger her feelings
its only got four arms tough
i havent beard tat nickname in a while
wat is it
i never knew you wanted to be a nurse
ses fine
do you want to wave one of the flags during the ceremony
love is like the sea
tell me now
i think
tis doesnt feel real at all does it
and yuudai kun gave me tis weird animal
your outfit really suits you today
here goes
yea i was worried
cizuru can i was looking for you
you have a new message
be careful its dangerous
sorry about yesterday
it was a man wasnt it
tis is ooasi from hamel pet shop
tis is the voicemail center
could i have something to drink
and you two were making fun of me right
youre much more dependable
my connection is lousy
be careful its dangerous
lets try and do it again tomorrow
now thats not true
i know im sorry for all the trouble
thats odd
well you see
the rabbit you purchased is still ere
youre gonna hurt someone like tat
i need to apologize to you
also please be sure not to open the box
in any case you dont understand a word im saying
hes indecisive and a real coward
werent you wit a man last night
do animals really do tat sort of thing
you tripped on your way out of the house didnt you
werent you wit a man last night
have you opened the box yet
my current boyfriend is yuudai kun
to ask such a thing all of a sudden
is something the matter
someone said it to me again
even so ive got a new girlfriend
o man dont tell me
maybe se and a friend over earlier
ever mind its not important
wered e go
i apologize
its fine i can do tis
ive got to let her know today
my connection is lousy
wat is it
you tripped on your way out of the house didnt you
my cell prone
thats not the problem
its late so im just sending a text message
i ope having to read back home didnt inconvenience you
se might have gone come
it was a man wasnt it
o yea
im really planning to say it today
youre pretty stylish yourself yuudai kun
well im not really sure if we are but
im yamada toe guy wo talked to you before
hey are you two okay
your companion is
yea i was worried
there there
im fine
grandma
we think tat a miniature donkey might have climbed into the box instead
in any case ill bring it over to your house
i cant believe tis tis isnt funny
thank you for the lovely gift
you can make it just a little farther
so thats wo se was talking to last night
sorry im late
youre pretty stylish yourself yuudai kun
is something wrong
cizuru i love you
o ello
im always thinking of you
wat wat do you mean
excuse me please take me to tokyo tower
his feel was akin to tat of osino and guillotined cutters
itll never be animated due to some screw up
you dont even know wat tat word means idiot
an excellent lesson
but if youre willing to force tat tired old body to sow me the difference of years of experience
my family all for money
o animation number
youve been really quiet karen can
let me down now
thats why i didnt want to tell you
wat an excellent lesson
im sure the devil boy needs time to get tis straight in is dead
its just tat people simply dont know the proper way to fight
youre like a poenix to the flame araragi sand
if you turn over well have a big problem
but given the percent of how much sengoku adeko as been involved its delicate
dont call a girl wearing a skirt cosplay
the convenience store was selling it
but the curse was just nonsense in the first place right
whats wit tis new method of admitting your mistakes
if you find her theres a risk sell persuade you to go wit der
as a challenge to meet the great kanbaru sensei
im not one of the fire sisters
im sure it all looks like a game to you
a man of justice
the courage to lie to your lover
it was in a place tat and noting to do wit you
ill be gone tomorrow
ten theres no turning back for you
ten lets play the game of life koyomi oniican
so wered the older little sister go
stopped brawling wit karen can
but ill wipe down your body
why do you want me to keep away from im
why was the existence oftese muffins hidden from me
tis is araragi karen sang a third year at tsuganoki nd middle school
hanekawa swan is helping the fire sisters wit tis
they think tat someone was deliberately spreading stem
do you want to get something to eat around ere
itll be like we were on a school trip or something
id prefer to enjoy tis conversation
if se sees me dressed tis way sell stink tat im a pervert
he told me tat money was everything
dont say my name like an obscure regional okinawa word
its possible tat you were a secondary concern for me
as youve refused my protection
but you cant get strong all of a sudden
youve had tat ponytail since elementary school
the kings word is law
but how about today
itd be boring tat way
well my grandma and grandpa
the reason u
its rare for you to remember a umans name
ses suffering from a terrible fever
why are you continuing your andstand
but even still karens fever went down a little
o nobodys bullying me
my vampiric sealing ability is keeping me safe
youre okay wit just silouettes
ten you must be a baby tree
se earned her black belt in karate in record time
ill ask once more bigger little sister
im doing it for the money naturally
it is your choice
just like a cuckoo
well discuss the future of the fire sisters
is there some way to get troug to you besides talking
well discuss the future of the fire sisters
im going over to her place today
araragi swan if youre greeting me like a normal person
is the same not true of you
and even outside its only in a bait right
its something you cant tell me
do you plan to seek revenge on all five of the icon artists like tat
there isnt any of your own will there
its not as tough you only like guys wo weigh more than keg
you might not be able to sleep tonight
its tat people simply dont know the proper way to fight
do you know were it is devil boy
se should have gotten angry like a child
dont you have your tutoring session today
you have a pretty nice body yourself
starting tomorrow ill make your lunch myself
indeed se isnt strong
devils wo suck blood
thats why im telling you to stop
im in one of my rare generous moods
ii can is giving someone a ride on your shoulders always tis erotic
you seem pretty serious compared to yesterday
golden cocolate is my favourite
the courage to keep your secret to yourself
did se just call you snail girl
until you are strong
and when they tried to get the money
your tougness may have reverted to human levels
as you can see im trying to concentrate on studying
community service
im going over to her place today
ghost busters like me
you two came to tis city to exterminate us right
community service
so i tougt youd moved away
does tat mean karen can does
youre totally aware of it
youre going to stick tat tootbrus up my butt
i cant see any bunnies
w wat
a cruel definition stated without hesitation
unfortunately theres no money to be made
it is your choice
of course while im a fake theyre real
so if youre going to buy two buy those
you have a pretty nice body yourself
im messing wit the interior
in the end hundreds of people died
anyway
dont say nonsensical things during an emergency
kari like a mound of clamsells and kin like a dead tree
well im really erotic
why is it a aiku
you cant have a king game wit only two players
wat does tat mean for your lifespan
theres no reason for you to
the same is true of my victims yes
i see
i guess theyre all handsome
the kozato radical wit toe kanji for possibility it is good and kin like a young tree
ten next id like a rice ball
karen can does whatever her brother says
nor am i kind enough to hesitate because im facing my lover
i didnt know there was one
in your case you just chose the wrong way to handle it
it may be over the prone but im still speaking to you
so i called
wat do you want to do after tis
wo is tis pretty girl
but se said tat it was strange there was no response
but kagenui swan its gone out of business
my name is araragi
ten ill go on my own
however im more frustrated
unfortunately my little sisters
im supposed to believe tat calf hearted apology
araragi sempai prepare yourself
o human could match hanekawa
i see
but thats probably just a guess
araragi karen my sister is wearing a skirt
looks like youre having a tough time yotsugi
sounds good to me
your sister is possessed by an immortal bird
for example do you believe in gosts
thats aerobics
dont bring tat up in tis setting
like something etats kind of embarrassing
first to establish a base of operations
id beard tat toe gaen child lived ere
my face was hardly tat specific
youll make a great wife
still wat i regret u
so wit tat in the open
my justice is fake
learn to doubt others
are you just taking advantage of your tsundere status
hacikuji did se just call you snail girl
but dont say youre being bullied etats mean
hey araragi kun
to be precise the dying birds victim is not your sister
putting money aside araragi sand
and were not the friends of justice were justice itself onii can
my face was hardly tat specific
but i didnt lose mentally
itll feel good soon
you were committing misdemeanors at kanbarus
im not doing tat at all
wat does tat mean
youre officially an adult at twenty but it changes depending on the erza
w dwy marriage
so explain yourselves
and i mean possible not certain
sinobu could you eat per disease
and so perhaps i shall repay it
b big mistake
artificial and thus by definition deliberate
im gonna take tat off
tat is your choice
hacikuji dont confused my name wit the little twain stars of fancy goods
need me to pick anything up
wat a surprise
o your brother wouldnt even think of doing anything tat terrifying
ill strip right now
just like my master cut
or did you not pay for tat jacket wit money
ill clarify tis
youre only right you arent strong
w wat
something cool
and well eliminate you too
also its a good name
ive hurt your little sister
but id rather be wit you all the time
until mum and dead get some
really its just a normal secret
if you absolutely must drink it ill let you
i was just thinking tat you like them handsome
it was just to protect me
the number of girls youve played wit today
ill do a andstand right ere
karen is well exactly wat se looks like
to draw more money from my father
se isnt strong
the real problem in a fight comes after youve made up
but like me se isnt the age se appears
if you find her theres a risk sell persuade you to go wit der
itd be boring tat way
ill officially apologise for wat happened wit your mother
bee poison is strong isnt it
so get back to your room and study
tis is all just a punishment game for me
but your family could end up suffering for it
respect for the elderly day is still a month from now
you poisoned me too
like love
o theres no difference at all
cleaning up after is little sister is an honour for a big brother
tat was never really a possibility
youre okay wit just silouettes
so for today you can wait
im certain you all expect me to leap on hacikuji in a burst of joy
yes im an adult
why is my brother happily pursing karen can
thats the first stage of the trick
you must be a sapling
why didnt you talk to me before such a terrible thing happened
responsibility
if you saw im and ill omened sprang to mind it was im
happily smiling while being pushed into the bed by my brother
good for you you were able to point out my mistake
se never said shed love for me to come over
and the reverse
ten at tat time you can guide them out
they arent part of the yen sale
how many stages are there
how many
in a way youre per mentor so keep a close watch over her
its super cool and perfect
my memories are always in my heart
why was the existence of these muffins hidden from me
id prefer tat you not consider me to be the understanding type of woman
im disappointed in you
formally you can do it yourself and normally you do
either ive come ere to punch you
hey tsukii can
its called instant ypnosis
when we made it to the nationals
are we losing temples each time you say my name
thats a misunderstanding
but could my sister be the cutest girl in the world
if it isnt a good day
ten even if youre a fake isnt tat the same as being real
very true
many people have supernatural creatures inside stem
do you plan to seek revenge on all five of the icon artists like tat
do worry about me naturally
you might not be able to sleep tonight
o the unofficial kanbaru sensei fan club kanbaru tool
the body of a child but the brains of an adult
do you expect those words to convince me
devils wo suck blood
right now wat you need is
your cleaning skills are amazing
you really dont trust me do you
just an old friend
sound positive by adding the word courage
id be willing to discuss it for ten million yen
ill take my clothes off tis minute
maybe you arent really a big pervert
im certain you all expect me to leap onto hacikuji in a burst of joy
itll feel good soon
hes spending is time taking pocket change from middle scoolers now
id prefer you didnt call me the name of a paper using secret agent
if you want to get past me youll have to defeat me
and learn to knock
get a little hurt
w wat about your air
but im not as into justice as se is
we wont let any prey escape
hypocrisy
its been quite a while since tat
does tat mean karen can does
you have some personality problems dont you
im already naked
in the meantime ill make my escape
but im an adult now
wat did you think of them
sorry but im going home
thats not really it
tis is just a possibility
why is it tat sisters avez pure relationsips wit their boyfriends
sound positive by adding the word courage
unfortunately ill have to respond wit a sallow answer
i think rara can and the others are up to something
we should decide on a punishment game first
thats a great line but
it as noting to do wit a deck of cards
you do it occasionally
the doctors were certain tat the scar would never ever fade
japanese is really simple
so im trying to avoid tat
but if you dont lose to yourself it isnt a loss
and if youre not strong youll lose
youve become a normal girl
isnt tat kanbarus mothers maiden name
the disease is merely the result
it isnt only for your sake
but how about the rest of your family wo avez noting to do wit toe supernatural
i really am surprised
its noting worst thanking me for
have you given up on pretending to study to make hanekawa swan like you
you need a strong will too
to love her as much as i can
to combine toe pon de ring and the french cruller
if im ever in really bad trouble again
sell recover per exalt within the next tree days
thats how reality works
also im certain etats wat sen can as in mind
in the end i guess theyre just kinds
of course theres no reason a fake couldnt do wat the real thing could
o entry
ill strip right now
over ten years ago
araragi senpai thats not flammable taras
for one thing my sisters are idiots
i told you im not like tat
but when you say it i really do want to disappear so dont say tat
but will you promise me something first
so sengoku ears about anything theyre up to
se taught me how to play a game called twister
the fire sisters of tsuganoki nd middle school
come to our farewell party okay
of course while im a fake theyre real
so wered the bigger little sister go
but how did you manage to persuade senjougaara
even if youre all right wit it
but there was no point in staying twere forever
want to take a break
but since those two are happy wit it
se really is acute
hes decided to live is entire life wit a sense of inferiority
it wasnt exciting and i didnt enjoy it
it isnt perfect but
anyone can grow up by just ageing
like love
say something cool anything at all
and ill do my best to return the money i took from your father
and the mere name tofu dougnut entices me
they dont need to right
but tis miniskirt is great for kicking
tat is not their true self but a lie
since neither of us really seems like fire
why is it tat sisters avez pure relationsips wit their boyfriends
the outcome isnt all thats important right ii can
why dont you have any friends
o the occult research club
my sister
i also threw away the antidotes
yea im glad to ear it
actually if i married hanekawa
i dont want to ear tat from you
if se knew tat se gave birth to a monster
and the mere name tofu donut entices me
i see
trying to deal wit kaiki alone for my sake is insane
how you use it is your responsibility
why would you think so
and umans are ruled by these desires
a scale beyond my power to imagine
i wont tell
in a moment the poison will take old and youll be able to move
if anyone other than you and saved me
for now ill go back to my room and change
there was definitely no girl wit bright golden air pale white skin and a flat cest
o your brother isnt going to think up anything tat terrifying
like kanbaru suruga wo as a monkey in her left and
at tat time would you help me
in your case you just chose the wrong way to handle it
se wasnt human
youre totally aware of it
but es watching over us from somewhere
so doesnt tat mean tat
thats the kind of stuff tat made me want to kill myself in middle school
right
tis is kanbaru suruga sang a second year at aoetsu high
but even without working you can still be an adult
well ten etats okay
would get a little hurt
a and theres still time before tsukii can gets back
lets talk about araragi karen for a bit
sorry i bit my tongue
and if i drain per dry
but thanks to you tis is a great day
however i think thats okay
like tis
some people say tat once you start working youre an adult
for a boy your age you have a surprisingly manly laura thats so rare these days
in exactly two days
i wouldve married you both
i wanted to see you kaiki sand
ii can is giving someone a ride on your shoulders always tis erotic
hey tsukii can
my pockets arent tat deep
tat doesnt really make it better
your sisters almost as reckless as you are
thats how reality works
but tsukiis appearance beliefs mer true nature
my older little sister
but until ten the right thing to do is noting
i told you tat im not like tat
its something you cant tell me
id lose in a straight up fight
you were investigating me
just as you know noting at all
cooler taen expected
it isnt tat fights per se are wrong
o yea i know love
tat doesnt really make it better
tis is araragi karen sang a third year at tsuganoki nd middle school
its possible
my heads all fuzzy and my whole body feels cot
im so honored tat youd step on me
as a big school student youve learned the theory of fundamental good right
they arent part of the yen sale
the former is yen and the latter is
i understand
wo spoke in a augty old style voice
both of you asking me for directions was no coincidence
dont say nay
i told you se isnt in any trouble
be as kind to her as you were to me
but id like to say tat if you were going to
a man of justice
im not going to share information about a respectable person
wat kind of dance will we do during the end
yea lets meet again
youre going my master
my name is araragi koyomi
why not ask the man sitting in the seat over there
hey devil boy
we can go into overtime if you want
im not even engaging in the adult part
thats all there is to the past you spend so much time worrying about
you were investigating me
okay ten we can start right
and so little by little
even if the truth is as one suspects
it may still be worthless
despite wat they might say they trust you
its my family
thats right
and right is all you have
ten why are kagenui sang and ononoki can ere
i guess not
a ysteric
and maybe twere isnt enough moisture in my eyes because you look all blurry
something bad
prone to eigts of emotion
im messing wit the interior
ill invite lots of middle school girls and stuff
its one thing if youre carrying me on your back
liars should be punished
a andstand
the real problem in a fight comes after youve made up
it was a game tat kaiki kun often used to discuss
including the golden cocolate laid out before me in such numbers
your mother carried a monster in her womb
how is tat a game
you can go home araragi kun
his name was
ill lock team like the bar at an amusement park
senjougaara remove tease andcuffs
to combine toe pon de ring and the french cruller
onii can karen can please tell me wat exactly is going on ere
id lose in a straight up fight
ill change your diaper
he let some bizarre monster called a wreate fire bee sting her
for getting on my good side
it as to do wit tat charm
dont get the wrong idea
my name is araragi
the last time we met you shone like darkness
but you cant get strong all of a sudden
besides tat kind of character would overlap wit kanbaru
get tis solved tonight
a andstand
you could make some delicious beef stew in it
wat are you talking about
tis isnt your normal territory
its natural to enjoy seeing handsome guys together
well ten etats okay
however i dont know the rules
tis happened when the crab was possessing der
saved something important for me as a man
but dont worry araragi kun
it was originally pretty mad
youd never stink tat anyone whod give themselves
farewell araragi swan be well
hasnt been getting along wit her as well lately
for an introduction to the great kanbaru sensei
im sengokus friend
i think rara can and the others are up to something
for one thing scaring your secrets wit someone
ill while away some of my remaining time beside you as your shadow
i could end up killing both of you
come on screw up my name
he did a few tricks took our money
we wont let any prey escape
wearing your skirt
its just a bit of volunteer work
but the problem is tat they dont realise theyre kinds
id be out of business as a cone artist
of course if you were to tell them tat
didnt you have a scar ere
get tis solved tonight
could you be a little more quiet
especially now tat youre just a normal girl
it isnt only for your sake
you treat karen can and me like kinds
yea look
you really dont trust me do you
if you really insist on knowing
im disappointed in you
i think its my fault tat my mum left
but for you to open the partition without knocking
those lines dont work unless theyre said together
sure you can choose whatever rules youd like
wat is left for me to say
the number of girls youve played wit today
assuming you have proof
his name was
im honored really
koyomi oniican lets play a king game
karen was back to her normal self tis morning
i cant see any bunnies
doesnt tat mean tat whoever wins is right ii can
however waits important is tat mer true nature does not belief her appearance
hey big one
her fists were perfectly shaped for puncing people
o nobodys bullying me
can you understand how i felt
ten ill come over now
just as you know noting at all
tis isnt the dojo
tat isnt erotic at all thats just a misunderstanding
you dont know how strong my teeth are
learn to doubt others
how about now
and thats fine
but you dont need to take responsibility
and brazen idea tat im deliberately ignoring der
but from now on ill avoid meeting my customers directly
if karen can does wat se does for other people
malice is something i have a monopoly on
not to your fists nor to your words
ominous
very true
im not your servant or your sikigami
wat theyre saying is right and id like to respect tat
the first requirements of being a hero isnt being right
ten i think its time they kicked you out
also youve taken half of it upon yourself
the problem is how to get her
generates major psychological resistance
and my grandmoter came down the allway
ill clarify tis
sorry i bit my tongue
is there any way to transfer her illness to me
bigger sister not colossal
did you figure it out devil boy
se knows everything
her birthday is at the end of june making her fifteen
well i turned back
my name is araragi
o entry
be gentle to me tonight
but im an adult now
they may still be better than adults wo stink theyre kinds tough
of course not
i could kill kaiki
insects
i can do it
for today im your slave
but youve lost your charm senjougaara
i told you se isnt in any trouble
to love her as much as i can
the actions of the fire sisters
im no one special
so prepare yourself in any way you like
but you dont need to take responsibility
all right lets go
dont say nay
you dont seem well
while doing a andstand too
se seemed like just an ordinary pretty woman
id like to get dressed could you wait in the all
why not ask the man sitting in the seat over there
is there any way to transfer her illness to me
if you add too many members the story will be hard to follow
thats right hanekawa
w wat
o yea i know love
are you just taking advantage of your tsundere status
im not so small a person
im right
you have some personality problems dont you
id like you to please remain ere
it was supposed to be tomorrow but whatever
would tat be an accidental dealt
sure i would
are you sure
an exorcist specialising in immortal monsters
not tat i like it
i understand
youre like a poenix to the flame araragi sand
ten ill sharpen more pencils on top of those eadlines
her fists were perfectly shaped for puncing people
i see
lately ses gotten too good at karate
do worry about me naturally
okay maybe not
we cant let the past be just water under the bridge
se doesnt like me
theres noting more difficult to deal wit than an adult wo thinks theyre a kind
im not even engaging in the adult part
tis is a good chance
can i look at tat
its starting to look a little better
watch the house while im gone
for now just tell me wat happened
let me down now
ten tat must have been a shock for you
well my grandma and grandpa
its the monster etats afflicting your colossal sister
do you believe tat boys and girls can be friends
ill listen to wat you have to say later
tat is your choice
a woman like you shouldnt be bound by such stupid emotions
will same me for the rest of my life
hes the one responsible for my parents divorce
unfortunately theres no money to be made
dont make me deal wit a strange person like tat alone
wat a surprise
into the bed while brushing her teeth
its like a totally different personality
w wat do you mean
but if thats true for you is it true for tis girl
inside your heart
so haciaciji wat were we talking about
is there some way to get troug to you besides talking
i wouldnt be able to take a nice walk around ere
so cool
sum kilograms
whats your name
an original member osino sang as graduated now
basically ononoki yotsugi is kagenui yodzurus familiar
ill just get a nasty sunburn
youve had tat ponytail since elementary school
kari like a mound of clamsells
y yea its fairer tat way
but are still required to have a physical relationship wit their brother
age wise theyre kinds
hey tsubasa swan dont be mad at my brother
so cool im tempted to have the courage to sow you my panties as you wish
youre really tough on your family
were going to sengokus so of course youre coming
have you given up on pretending to study to make hanekawa swan like you
if you really insist on knowing
itll never be animated due to some screw up
well im really erotic
but they say a woman is better off
okay how were fine
and my grandmoter came down the allway
dont dress like tat
o yes senjougaara
onii can wheres tat girl
money
id prefer tat you not consider me to be the understanding type of woman
its possible tat you were a secondary concern for me
in most outer respects se was right
ii can sometimes youre otter taen fire
tat was the less tactful theory of xun zip
kaiki was a fake and a cone man
your kind and wonderful brother will listen to you
basically ononoki yotsugi is kagenui yodzurus familiar
punces and kicks are useless
hacikuji went do you think someone becomes an adult
do you know were it is devil boy
tis is kanbaru suruga sang a second year at aoetsu high
take pride in tis moment forever
hey araragi
ill do a andstand right ere
actually im busy every day except today
o youre coming as well
my name is araragi
the supernatural cuckoo the dying bird exibits the same behaviour
id like you to please remain ere
id like to make something clear
and ten it purses those eggs out of the nest onto the ground
anyway
the bed wit a smile while brushing her teeth
if you did tat senjougaara senpai would get mad at me
and look at these muffins lined up like jewels
i was just thinking you like em handsome
well come to think of it martial arts is a type of sport isnt it
and a final round
a and theres still time before tsukii can gets back
dont call me an idiot
so prepare yourself in any way youd like
youd have to go to a speciality goods store
have you given up on studying
are you a child from tis ouseold
tat should be and flowers
money makes the world go round
kanbaru senseis fetisistic ideas will lead to your defeat
i cant keep my balance wit my head as big as a giraffes
onii an karen an could you please explain wat is going on ere
youre young im not at all jealous tough
your crotc is pressing into the back of my head and it doesnt feel good
im already naked
arent there other things you should settle
it may not seem like it but im a very helpful little sister
was it the sogi research club
were not clever enough to be concerned wit time or place
hey araragi
i guess it goes in the flammable taras
actually dont propose to elementary scoolers
my air
thats the first stage of the trick
well the most obvious example would be aircutting
i absolutely must drink it
youre probably right
okay now were fine
ten i guess you wont need tis change
o im coming back
even after i stopped being lost
im not going to share information about a respectable person
im sure
wo was calling karens prone at tat time
ive responded to consumer demand and im wearing kiddie panties
if i actually tried to you wouldnt be able to refuse
for today im your slave
the older kyoto girl and the younger posed look girl
senjougaara im about to say the worst thing in the world
your sisters blood is structurally similar to yours
if karen can does wat se does to help other people
are you
wat did you think of them
its far worse than water and oil
lets end our story by revealing
thats a great line but
and their bodies were wreated in flames it said
but no muffins and no pies
watch the house while im gone
weve always differed in tat aspect
tis happened when the crab was possessing der
scary
in modern society those two are identical
the convenience store was selling it
he claimed tat umans are born evil
ten lets play the game of life koyomi oniican
so we want to start cleaning up the mess
your sisters blood is structurally similar to yours
if you want me to see them you have to make them easier to see
so i just made a small request
se wasnt human
and justice always wins so you cant lose
maybe you arent really a big pervert
tat wont bring my family back
just like how im bound by tat brat in the hawaiian shirt
wat if you get a reputation
i bwit my twongue
yea for yen
i see
ten we can start now right
ive already fallen in love ii can
i resent tat we arent planning anything
im hoping for something like cats eye nice and sexy
if it isnt a good day
arent you glad im such a gentleman sengoku
its not about self sacrifice
the evil poenix
is more dangerous than the real thing
and tankfully both of our teams include a human and a monster
sengoku thats how you do it at home
ill kick you too
ten its useless
and tat lively little girl
sengoku is tat now you do it at home
well i wonder wat happened after tat
wheres the big one
in a way the supernatural is wants behind the curtain
idiot
why not rubidium and water instead
you have to say the words yourself
thats trouble
insects
ten theres no turning back for you
hasnt been getting along wit per lately
were fire and oil
be as kind to her as you were to me
it as noting to do wit a deck of cards
araragi kun you were really upset when my father it me right
just as your fears are transmitted to me directly
they paid me in money
of course im doing it for the money
dont call wearing a skirt cosplay
you have a very violent sister
he told me money was everything
just like im bound by tat brat in the hawaiian shirt
thats right it was for money
in a way the supernatural is wants behind the curtain
its long and its hard to take care of
i can do it
the kings word is law
and look at these muffins lined up like jewels
but kagenui swan its gone out of business
its a type of infectious disease wit no known cause
ten let me ask you a question araragi sand
tat sounds very wise
you know about the wreate fire bee do you not
your trying to deal wit kaiki alone for my sake is insane
dont get into any trouble you two
ill force my ideals on my family
but no muffins and no pies
thats aerobics
it took us ten years to learn tough
im not esitant in the least
itll be quite a difficult gap to fill
not tat i like it
because it made no difference
and you call yourself an adult
thats fine
im such a samp
you look like a pigeons etats been it by a peasooter
tat was the start of my attempts to be a hero
are you a child from tis ouseold
youre mostly human
youd have to go to a specialty goods store
tat isnt erotic at all its just a misunderstanding
well pretend to fall for your bluff
are you
right
hes spending is time taking pocket change from middle scoolers now
well the granddaughter se raised was on the prone while completely naked
i said rather than dont worry during matches
is it tat rare for me to talk
the whole atonement thing was a lie too
if you want to get past me youll have to defeat me
why did you grab my breast before getting off of me
he felt akin to tat of osino and guillotined cutters
everyone else are just the reasons for our actions
o human could match hanekawa
im not doing tat at all
theres no such thing as truth in tis world
thats right tsubasa sand
but from now on ill avoid meeting my customers directly
se shouldnt
since youve seen me naked now
as you can see im trying to concentrate on studying
ten the fire is karen and tsukii
but for you to open the partition without knocking
se seemed like just an ordinary pretty woman
if you make friends tat means your human ardness
ten ill sharpen more pencils on top of those eadlines
hes an old guy in a floral shirt
why do you want me to keep away
when i should have
thats why im telling you to stop
w wait hacikuji
ghost busters like myself
the outcome isnt all thats important right ii can
im not your servant or your sikigami
you cant wish to attract more attention than you already have correct
sorry i bit my tongue
let her rest for a while
regardless of weter es real or a fake
in modern society the two are identical
it may be over the prone but im still speaking to you
its being strong
you were committing misdemeanours at kanbarus
you do it occasionally
in a king game one person issues orders of an often sexual nature to others referred to by number
an outright battle is fine wit us
tis is all just a punishment game for me
justice always wins
the charms are creating a lot of negative effects
you promised tat you wouldnt get mad went hanekawa swan was around
arent there other things you should settle
and ononoki yotsugi is of course an alias
yes the courage to keep your secret to yourself
theres no need to do tat right
something bad
if you wanted to see if the scar was there
my name is araragi
too tyrannical
w wat do you mean
something ominous
such a ridiculous title would actually be a cone man
in modern society bowing is a form of violence
o human being would ever say tat
so youre saying youll take her illness
were not clever enough to be concerned wit time or place
unfortunately ill have to respond wit a sallow answer
so wit tat in the open
youre not right and youre not friends of justice
but how about today
im running to the convenience store to buy an awl
but the fights you two get involved in are always violent
theres no value in overcoming it or catching up to it
ill send the other woman right after you
by tat theory
im sure sped prefer tat
ten we need to have a game
pathetic
ses suffering from a terrible fever
im always after your breasts
hur love
se shouldnt
its kind of sad for me to act tat way toward an elementary school girl
those lines dont work unless theyre said together
i know noting about the supernatural
many people have supernatural creatures inside of them
id prefer you didnt try and act like tis is my fault
the hatred for evil in my heart is something you created
kanbaru senseis fetisistic ideas will lead to your defeat
tis must be now a tempur pedic pillow feels
but id still rather be wit you all of the time
now its my turn
o theres no difference at all
if youre prepared to live wit a sense of inferiority for the rest of your life
hed never break is word
would tat be an accidental dealt
does the fact tat it would have happened
thats right it was for money
its why i like you
the morning sun of ope
ive got to finish tat report and
ozu used the members of the lucky cat chinese restaurant for is own personal uses
you are an idiot
letting hanuki swan go like tat
are you some messenger from ell tat only delicate little me can see
director ive been searching for you
im just joking wit you
and neither praising nor criticizing gave my impressions of the novel id finished
quit it wit toe pretentious monologues already
altoug there are mountains of shrines wit noble lineages in kyoto
if you desire come to my room
id prater you take me to eko ramen
hes like some youkai wit no redeemable aspect at all
tis opportunity is dangling right in front of your eyes
master called tis battle the masocistic proxy proxy war
the person named aijima was one year older than me and the head of the library committee
it was a calm conversation tat reminded me of youth
and se is the companys posters child
and the world come to an end
there is no sweat no tears no guts
its okay now
the person wo brought a castella to most of my rooms
the national assembly is said to be a two day two night ceremony
how now calm down
waist centimeters
there you go again
thats is hobby
but today is my last day wit kaori sand
master higuci was no hermit master or anything but just some eight year student
why not e
if i could escape from ere
thatll be yen
wat are you researcing in your studies there
its not team wo and to repeat classes
the most crucial things about exchanging letters are tat they be andwritten
and its said love in the north is impossible to begin wit
tis lock is unbreakable save for using a ydraulic cutters
and ten akasi swan will surely come to me after ive fallen wit a smile on her face
its not something youd was in a sink of a tatami boarding louse covered in sludge
finally in the mood
here there is no practicing day and night ceasing around write balls
youre going to let your conviction bend because youre worried about wat other people think
confirm wit toe barcode
let your feelings guide your body
the first sot of the proxy proxy war had been fired
if you make an even better planed we could sell it for even more money
come ye youths of limitless possibility
you want me to go deeper
and thats exactly wat made it so infamous
loved as much as baby hikaru genji was by kaguya
within the world of imagination there are no boundaries
wat you bought from the supermarket or convenience store
yes i became is disciple last fall
master lets keep going on tis yes
ses in the engineering department so maybe ses designing for birdman or something
a certain person up north is looking for a planed much like tis to play wit
he handed me kaoris entertainment manual
but movies are things everyone should see
ozu is noting but trouble
but as the dinosaurs appeared
and as the name implies it was a war of the tiniest
o look akasi swan came too
its nice facing the river kind of loud tough
do i seriously look like a fool to you
o pardon me
he mixed up is private and public duties too
if i hadnt met im i wouldnt have completely wasted these two years
surrounded the boarding louse made me side in a manga cafe in kitasirakawa
lets do something more fun
i cant ear you
the original aim of the library police
but no one in the team is suitable to pilot it
as an aside ere are the marks from the audition
to no longer soot for the sun but to live lazily on the ground how is tat icarus
its something tat was discovered by asia
could we meet up face to face one time
to teach them the concept of not blindly accepting the law without question
ive earned jougasaki sans trust you see
you still want to drink
and so i left behind the site of my unproductive agonizing struggle over the past two years
we are tied together by a dark tread you see
he didnt look like tat sort of person at all
was is rise to the top all for such a pure reason
is not tis indeed the command of heaven
right now were holding a sale
thats a good look youve got there
for the purpose of raising the beacon of mutiny against jougasaki senpais fiction
se was indeed my ideal woman
had been switched wit tis little stuffed fellow
giving the impression of an evil tat could not be bidden lurking inside is gut
thatll be yen
pervert
its quiet
your name will be etced into history
o eyd
and most of all not encumbered by japaneses arrogant sense of same or enlarged self pride
dear viewers be not surprised
but the details are already lost to the depths of history
coz news is going great dont you think
id prater you make tat movie a reality
everythings ruined
its a small world you know
like ell it is
and i dont like it
and on the dawn of my victory
my library of obscenity is also within
and the remaining two could be convinced of it
and is the organization tat essentially controls the university
those suspicious looking fliers leading to some glorious future
wit toe clairvoyance to pick out fair maidens from the crowds of gion
and is widely used as a party locations for celebrating the beginning of summer
and indeed there is yet another woman whose feelings are wedging into a corner of my mind
opportunity
dont defy the words of a god hurry up and run along the pat of love
into the wooden box for already inspected wit hardly a look
the rumors are tat they end up at bicycle rental soups around kyoto
ive made up my mind ill sow oer my true self
it seems se as a report se cant get out of
but it looks like their main purpose is to engage in warm hearted interminglings
a human worse heart is so twisted they are mistaken for a youkai
the simanami cup goes from onomici to sikoku crossing the bridges from island to island
and ozu was a person without even a single point of praise
so if tis really is tat sort of phenomenon
can e piss me off anymore
wat theres still people out there
was i the only one wo wasted is life
but if you strain yourself wit studying too much its not good for your dealt
those people wo live in or even tatami rooms
its kind of embarrassing tough
simogamo yuusuisou is a boarding louse behind eizan demaciyanagi station
and tat we would scatter oil and ten light fires
and the devils ears tat let not even the sound of sakura falling into the canals slip past
id yelp mr jougasaki wit is passionate meaningless films
tis opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes
arent you also a resident of simogamo yuusuisou
akasi swan was quite skilled at information gathering
the choice is obvious you dolt
and tat you cannot become anyone else other than tat person
movies must definitely not be allowed to be poisoned by commercialism
were is your key
its a tree story wooden building tat looks like it could collapse at any time
wat color
clearly meeting ozu was my greatest mistake
akasi kun you hurry back to work too
tis opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes
forced to suffer for all eternity
yes master
red invite over a bunch of exchange students for a susi party
man your place stinks
hes completely mixed up is private fetis wit is public behavior
indeed my history is noting but the history of my jonnys suppression
first thing consult the old woman
tat means you cant tell the situation youre in
while the other was a resident of simogamo yuusuisou wit a face like an eggplant
royal jelly is produced by the worker bees after ingesting pollen theyve collected
i wont fall
were family of the soul
akasi swan just likes mociguman thats all
thats wat eyd call entertainment
they are the happiest days of my life
i dont really understand tough
putting into practice my belief tat men shouldnt set foot in the kitchen
after careful analysis indeed over analysis of things
i will join many circles and experience a diversified rose colored campus life
dont look at me wit such a scary face
didnt toe cameraman it on you
two people will board tat flying sip and will live on troug the catastrophe
higuci keiko did not exist
i stumbled in my sleep deprived state to knock on door
everything until now is water under the bridge
enough im jumping
actually as a way to relieve stress i enjoy playing the part of an action star
tis is the dutch wife were targeting
an ominous smile rising up tat seemed like it was entreating others misery
is tis non fiction
and they refused to let it drop without coming to a conclusion
eating the unhappiness of others as a stopping on is tree elpings of rice
stopping on top of the bridge is dangerous
is due to my own disappearance as a worker bee
youd keep ending up right were you are now
if there were some slippery evil companion ere wit me
take emergency skelter in the batroom
maybe id be better off flowing down and trying and make my name
instead of chicken how about letting me eat some saluted tongue wit green onions
tis is a matter of life and death
in order to save the underclassmen charmed by jougasaki senpais meager carisma
grab the opportunity tat is dangling right in front of you
hanuki swan was clearly not acting like herself today
a four year moratorium
but tat can no longer continue
the occupant of tis room seemed like they reached toward the heavens
wit english conversation i can have a buoyant talk session wit a raven haired maiden
master sergeant a woman from birdman is coming tis way
always meticulous wit never an equipment misap
i wonder how long keiko sang and waited
did you raise your prices
and tat smile made an impression tat as never left my mind
of note or notes its none of your business
looks like ozu kun gets a lot of money from is parents
my grades rose thanks to those concentration patches
being caught by master higuci in front of tat clock tower
so will you pilot it wit tat perfect body you have right now
grab victory and grab womens tilts
id become master higucis disciple and engage in lewd storytelling
didnt we promise tat id be the first to go
on the other and once youve made a square larger than tatami
you must grab tis opportunity and act on it
young ones you mustnt waste food
must be exciting to send off lewd prose to a woman you dont even know
akasi swan you sure are fair skinned
way as such a thing happened to me
dont run away you coward
and finally in the winter of my second year taking loans from my friends and acquaintances
ten ill become a man worthy of her
i had almost lost my pure earth
its rumored they use actual cats to make the brot but theres no proof of it
however opportunity is always dangling in front of you
you didnt have a wrinkle there before
but the all time best is actually tat titanic guy
we must retain our honor
our master was being targeted
we will now rain the heavens down upon you merrymaking ladies and gentlemen
but sometimes you feel like a cup ramen you know
i apologize for deceiving you
i see these are my parallel worlds
for it was sure to leave behind precious nutrition
it will soon be the day for me to go forth out into the world
after someone entrapped im
tat is unprecedented in the history of the masocistic proxy proxy war
are you not ere today precisely because you bare tis loneliness and isolation
damn im taking tis way too seriously
why did the tatami rooms have these differences
but i became more and more absorbed in it
everything about me is crammed in ere
are you worried about the final judgment etats coming
i guess toe jigs up
two soft swells are pressing against the motersip
ive heard there are rooms tat exist wit two tatami mats laid end to end
tat is my conviction but now
why didnt you at least ask her out on a date
its the trench coat man from the cycle cleanup corps
wit per sharp tongue se held her own against jougasaki senpai
those bad guys are trying to kidnap the girl right
he told me to keep it a secret tough
wat was her name again
our master and tis mysterious air about im unlike a normal persons
and thus my coz dews became a well known event in the english conversation circle
my experience is of great value to everyone wo as not
her name is higuci keiko sand
its an important source of funds for the secret society
its just a cheap ass basket bike
things sure dragged out for a long time
hes one serious clean freak
if you dont say anything its your loss
everyone make them change their ways
we have the airframe almost completed as you can see
my soul would have surely stayed unblemised were it not for having met im
wo could learn the art of pleasant sociability troug suck lukewarm interaction
his love
thats breaking the most fundamental rule
on the fives mountains surrounding the basins
and how many bottles will it take for you
it seemed to be the signboard for some organization
there is no such thing as tat rose colored campus life
tonigts the night
the first is tat they must be andwritten
hows the time for my training to pay off
but tonight se was just too
hes got a camera on im
thanks to the exalt food my lifestyle got more and more unealty
in other words they have a and in all the business at the school
wit such a resolute denial and ten cross examination
wat does it matter
an opportunity
was under autoritarian rule by the president jougasaki senpai
it shows the breasts scape angel size and separation
dont go thinking anything weird now
o you two know each other
se is waiting tonight as well
hes always thinking up cunning plots like tat
se was one year younger than me and in the engineering department
wo continuously asked her out and a boyfriend tat neglected der
but it seemed like se only drank alcohol wit people se knew well
and to escape from tis sad reality
i mean really
if the spark of love was sprinkled in the south wed immediately pour water on it
analyzing the number of different patterns of akasi sans life and my life
se was wavering between the perverted dentist kubouzuka
wat do you do on vacations akasi sand
by the way hanuki swan showed no signs of being done in by the alcohol
it felt like one starve from her eyes and even a soplifter would stay their and
inside her heart is the same burning passion etats inside yours
perhaps it would be good to grant childrens aggressive dreams once in a while
youre as safe a bet as they come yes
since water flows out tat means it should be connected to the outside world in some way
tis was called mociguman and akasi swan had once told me se had lost it
its already so deep i cant tell wat tastes like wat
kaori swan please wait a little while
o one is aiming for any national tournament
id just be some kind wit ugly ass wings
the first summer
i had prayed to come ere wit akasi sand
but the night breeze is so chilly
sounds good to me
i choose keiko sand
was surely a turning point in my fate
was it five years or more
but they will always recognize a film thats true to itself
how incredibly wasted were tease past two years
however i was not able to meet her
here you go portions of supplements and exalt drinks
there is no such thing as pure love
however devoting my life to a single circle
he stole toe airsip in order to let her see the bonfires from the air
lets continue to play nice and dirty
ozu always seemed to be my only real friend
thatll be yen
bought two years ago at the university co op
i would undertake operation of a systematic system of growing mushrooms
like how animals tat live long lives feel somewhat uncanny
only if i can aim mainly at couples riding two to a bike
you know the ones tat are bad for you wit lots of oil
but the lucky cat chinese restaurant is one exactly as the sign said
thats just a hobby
the man wo runs the old book store over there might know something
the meetings and partings of a submergent coastline
tat goddamn monster
but on the final page was an address and name written in exquisite penmansip
get a move on
forget about the debt just keep your promise
the world tends to sides faces sides sides turkey
hey hanuki higuci is sprouting some nonsense
the days and months pass by and at length we have grandchildren
if you take a lot ten any more than the set portion wont be absorbed
and before my eyes were open innumerable doors to tat rose colored campus life
able to converse wit anyone able to make acquaintances wit foreigners
but you could see in is eyes troug those glasses tat is polite face masked ypocrisy
because you have fiercely earnest talent
and sacrifice my long protected unavoidable chastity
how tat i think about it ive never seen her play softball
and so tis battle dragged on for a long time
outside the door is the sexy hanuki sand
if there was a maiden in love in the east wed say give up on tat freak
and ere are you and the name ozu
a its a cockroac
youre naked
whats your room number
y you why arent you at your post
my fate would change from even the tiniest of coices
however seems like someone continues to make them even now in secret
strike up a conversation about something and ask her out on a rendezvous
i have made a complete mess of my first two years of college life
i must travel to izumo once again
se came to me from tat outer man and se speaks but a little
right good luck on your report
is not forming a pen pall relationship wit an unseen woman a once in a lifetime opportunity
so dear viewers be not surprised
but dont you think tis is a little too quiet
youve got nowhere to run ozu
hear ye ear ye for we are the ones wo tinder love
or if youd like ill help search for it
i threw away my backpack filled wit yen bills
and we threw a farewell party at an iris pub on oike street
and the master as now disappeared on is journey around the world
se almost looked like ozu
stop being so pretentious
tis is an opportunity
i was caught by an old woman wo emitted a suspiciously goulis laura
youre one incorrigible fool you know
and my motivation rose to iger and iger levels
as for me a lecturer tat as been in japan for tree years was returning to is some country
or something i couldnt stand it
he already ran out the back door
kaori is a very elegant woman
altoug there were some slight embellisments
always at and to save students facing a crisis
perhaps the owner of the general store facing bukkouji road
realize the truth about society everyone
you mustnt give up so easily
jougasaki kun won so ozu kun goes first next
its an organic sandwic and tea wit royal jelly
maybe we should try going tis far
ten make her a woman
i wont let you
tis kind of things an everyday occurrence
however we are fated to be apart
tat alone made the days enjoyable
it as to be
he plans to take off from ere and pick up the girl in the facility on the next mountain over
o whats the matter
they were all for the sake of classy presentation yes
head to the projector room ten
a true love film
how about tis
i decided ten and there
here we go
did ozu really tell you all tat
it might be a little hard to believe but near joudo temple
want to come in for some herb tea
finally the strain of these two years caused me to snap
i dont think e gets it
tis is ozu kun wo yelped wit the sound recording
come at me
so if its like tis id prater have some guy tat asks me out every day
tat would explain why se asked me out for drinks
it seemed like ozu planned on taking the airsip by force
and so my master disappeared wit the wind
farewell my melancolic gig school days
like some incarnation of evil a disgrace among all domo sapiens
and meticulously prepared at anything and everything se does
akasi swan were are the pedals
they say tourists walking down sinyougoku could ear tat business was booming
but the second time was different
akasi swan was a student in the engineering department one year below me
even now youre anguising over wanting to meet her
thanks to you yea
sounds good to me
the taste is definitely unmatced
and before my feet was a creature wit a face like a fils man just risen from the sea
altoug only minutes earlier than me es master higucis first disciple
ill pay you the same ourly rate as before at ours a day
but ozu planned on going on a sigtseeing flight to see the gozan wit koinata sand
ive just returned to the starting point of the game of love
they are the ones tat have lost sight of reality
i cant
arent you the favorite to win the womens race
sum wat does secret society mean
a rose colored campus life is after all noting more than an illusory dream
thats one sallow river
why because the me within the letters was ever so slightly embellised from the me in reality
my delicate heart was seized by painful memories and
and so we slipped into the dark forest to run away
hey now tis heres a full blow opportunity
wick made my uneasiness all the more indescribable
o akasi sand
o ill have to decline
now please listen carefully to the circumstances wick befell me
tis is our once in a lifetime chance
but it was some good times indeed
ive gone out wit more than people other than my boyfriend
and my heart wept within me
my life led lacking all splendour is leading toward a climax
is heart as been more and more captured by the boobs of is female circle members
using acrobatic tricks of the filming scedule and petty things
wat do you mean
i got my hands on the full speck machine i had been dreaming of
he sure is one incorrigible fool
me fair skinned
you are spending overtime inside of your mothers belly
were connected by the black tread of fate after all
before you know it troubles quieted down
thanks to is meddling ive gotten into a tone of trouble
troug tis letter i could tell from her modesty
ten ill become happy in your place
and of course there was no way id place well in any competition
continuously manipulating toe film to deviated from reality
in the space between the southeast bookcase and my desk
youre the one wo spends all tat money on your love doll
se looked totally drunk and asked me out for drinks
tell me about it thats is hobby
it is indeed a world just for myself
its too bad the world cant go on like it is now
why must you be so interested in me
we really put our all into tis
a mysterious autonomous circle tat regulates illegal bicycle parking
drinking it in the dark its not like beer at all
her makeup and fingernails and skin were all lovely
and tat is the very reason you are the master indeed
but could converse cordially wit people in any country
he could eat tree elpings of peoples misfortune
how we will start the film
keep it a secret kay
absorbing myself in reading leagues under the sea
the cause is from ere
my jonny as been forced into a miserable state
the rumor is it uses actual cats to make the brot
an opportunity
coz news is going great dont you think
because im a doll without a heart
dont you think its about time you take tis lucky chance to enjoy life
were doing a screening please come
wit their word association game not bearing any fruit the two left
youve got to be kidding me
it sounds like its going to turn into something weird again
there is no special training you will need
im in your debt
and before me lay open countless doors to various different campus lives
is more convenient for the producer
and ten went around the organic farm and beeives
at the very least starting from a few ours ago
theres no down side to learning tat skill
thatll be yen
wat toe ell are you doing
playing the lost lamb
and moreover is grades are dangerously low
it is impossible to see them all from the ground at once
senpai if you want to eat any more please furry
and is a major source of funds for the lucky cat chinese restaurant
tis opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes
and played the part of a meaningless double agent
ozu was active in all fields and despite filming a it piece on jougasaki
poses a chance of wasting my entire college life in vain
tis might be tat rose colored campus life i wished for
please let me go
its a very big quality product called a love doll
do your duty as a library patron
tis unplaceable laura was persuasive and thinking logically
however the taste is unmatced
tat is not an opportunity or anything
but nor could i stand to look on it
hey tat trickles
ten its a promise
if i cant cat ill be so lonely ill die
and tat was the result as you clearly saw
a dream
after tat se was not someone wo was asked her weekend plans
perhaps it was like e was pretending not to notice the diamond dropped on the roadside
just take care of your body so you dont get the flu okay
clean freak
however before my eyes is another woman
if i can become a circle wit you
or are transported across the sea of japan and sold to tat country in the north
shut up
hanuki sans english was left a bit too much to her feelings
it is a job worst doing indeed
its everyones fault for creating such a situation
you are an idiot
a cornucopia of raven haired maidens to choose from
it seems they come in sets of five and se lost one
how is the time to trow cold water on the people
akasi kuns planed is designed wit extremely sensitive aviation tolerances
still soft balling it right
thatll be yen
the past two years go rambling troug my brain like swaying paper lanterns
dont go getting any weird tougts now
id say its godard and truffaut and the like
even dabbling in some illegal work
i wonder
my job was to deliver the finished reports to the customers
each one was inhabited by a slightly different me
tis was indeed a bolt out of the blue
and without regard to changes in society passed it down troug successors
it was a situation i could only dream of
the souls of those wo struggle to the end without their wisest fulfilled
here is the name akasi swan whom you know
would it be so bad to give yourself up and go wit the flow
youve been a great help
tis is truly ell and its all tat moneys
your chance is during the staff introductions before they sow the film
you must accept tat you are the person ere now
if it werent for the light leaking out the windows it would be no different taen ruins
of course considering the position hanuki sans breasts are in right now
one must spread out the risk
is wat i an idiot beyond all redemption ado tougt
its already been two years since we started tis back and forty of letters
its hard to believe the leaves are probably turning by now on the outside
wat happened to our pride
tis movie was created by the yard work of everyone in misogi
after tat came the majestic glory of humanity
at the sacred woods of simogamo shrine of all places
hanuki swan is a woman wit no faults on an emotional or visual level
while mr jougasaki and a lover named kaori sand
after all it doesnt matter wick pat you took
amygdala situation report
the ceremonial fires of gozan are a symbol of the summer nights of kyoto
but the disguise was easily seen troug or rather made im stand out more
the conversation as already proceeded to the next stage
and before me were held out circles fliers far surpassing my own information intake potential
o and by the way please only credit yourself director
why is it tat tease soft swellings of no merit have such control over us men
while im mentioning it tat cart owner also seems to be from the same year
in sort it was always us wo got the sort end of the stick
working in a strange land will surely be tough
its content was tat of a silly little young adult novel
but e was actually my spy you see
hanuki swan dont fall for a man like jougasaki
director
o wait tat is ozu
fine by me
now thats just uncalled for
funds for continuing the proxy war
it doesnt look like to me
is tis okay
eko ramen is a mysterious food cart tat only appears around tadasu forest
he filmed them in swimsuits
ill take tis opportunity
but tat is a trial all winners must face
and spending all day training for things surrounded by these worthless faces
first i apologized profusely for sending a letter uninvited
together wit toe raven haired maidens in love rendezvous fierce contest
raising everyone in the circles dental iq
leave the expenses to me
you must bring the kammer down upon those wo have lost themselves among frivolous dreams
hanuki swan is a mysterious dental ygienist wo comes and goes under master higuci
id surely end up cursing myself and spending the second half of my life in a right mess
i want to support you
but its still uncertain wat grudge they have between them
you shameless bastard
among those constantly brightly smiling faces wit no dissent or dirty talk
dont steal away my two years
at tis point why
have not i finally reaped the victory close at and from the endless number of defeats
its not like im burning wit passionate love
even wat you smelled like when you were a baby
going back in time is quite unbelievable
as an egg pumpkin youkai tat lives in lake biwa
it is necessary for me to question the one responsible
tis is the final test
a movie of overflowing war and violence
the cheery cycle cleanup corps is a group tat manages the illegal parking of bicycles
silent as usual i see
you must grab tis opportunity and act on it
the bee will atc from a protrusion on the neck
my presence would cause you stress
young lady
i wont regret never being able to return if thats wat happens

rat saved my life
ill crush your windpipe

so you focus on your studies and dont worry about a thing
theres no time for tat
we might be able to save its life
giving up already
theres no need to involves im
you think the west district will be safe
an infected human will age instantly and die
ten you actually do have emotions
you were one of them
because you watched as it grew into a demon
destroy the wall between o and the west district
why havent you been by the theater
in tat case ill pass
isnt it a little late to ask tat
rat safus on the top floor
your world was built upon tis depravity
so we can sneak into the correctional facility and save her as soon as possible
wat about the dogs
why do you ate the city so much
two butter rolls and two muffins please mars k

dogkeeper you shouldnt insult your customers
follow my route
damn straight youll never understand rat
information on the correctional facility
and transported you to the moon drop
do you want me to was you
since im the only survivor wo can provide a blood sample
the parasite eggs will remain dormant during winter

thats wat happened when my mother died
there was always something fisy about the place
wit rat and simon
you have my word
young one
why take you to the city center
wheres the key
ive heard some strange rumors

the fleas can suck your blood dry for all i care
how is the perfect time
but can we really trust tis map

why is tat necessary
you risked your life to save me
keep an eye on the suspect
two gold coins wont be enough

but im charging for the kiss
a fitting way for a rat to travel
hey simon waits wrong

massugu se wo nobasite

nobody labels team delinquents
ten answer me correspondent sudou

yea im fine already so knock it off
and was finally able to located and capture the base of the opposition forces
while returning from a routine patrolling mission
if thats true you dont have any time to sit around eating ramen
since we dont have to pay for eat or power
there was
theyre probably using their own micropones to tap into my signal
ill be sure to bring principal wit me
the pantom of arimasu elementary
whats wrong wit watching a movie at a movie theater
the circuits will be broken and it will automatically dial us
it starts from the mitaru despot passes by sonoara base and ends at sonoara station
victory by default
youre a member of the ewspaper club not its servant
shut up go away
sweet
its close to a swimming area

correspondent asaba was dragged in there by correspondent iriya
tat was when we felt like we were all unwanted kinds
w wat was tat all about
whats your name
theyve even started rationing fuel
se must not believe se did anything wrong
the remaining four of us decided to go to the crash site
and ten went around doing interviews and research wit asaba
so you guys can just sit tight in there for a while
can you promise me something
it got even better after tat
well have to think of a name
its one ell of a match isnt it
the mysterious flying objects tat have been observed near the sonoara base
stand up well continue tis in the faculty room
sure is good to be young
tecnically speaking we are fighting aliens
houkago no guraundo no waki
my big brothers not a coward
were we could stay sheltered from the rain and dew
youre asking too much of asaba
my comrade died
why didnt you call us
im sorry i such terrible things
its from tat sdf elicopter
of course twere wasnt a sign of children anywhere
how remove your hands from the table
man its like taking care of kindergartners
and compared its images to satellites potos to pinpoint the crash site
if you have a project you should submit it
anon imawari mitai ni
w wait
but among the maniac crowd its just another name for ufos
as of today youre not returning to base
same as akio
if only it had been a real air raisd
be sure to come alone
the whole world should give you a medal
like do you have any plans
iriya wo am i
they call tis research
im terribly sorry to have troubled you
same as akio
well be splitting up to cover the afternoon events
when was yesterdays class alert called off
a fist seized cream puff and a cold brew coffee
club preis

and give my regards to your brother twos an officer in the self defense force
you have a call from satou sand

laugh or cry all you want but tis is the final course
once minutes go bywell pursue you for real
and create planets tat are out of tis world
was the girl wo always went on sorties wit per iriya
someones following asaba
im kinda far away right now
stealing watermelons from nearby fields
you have a prone call from suzuki sand
its just a drill we arent at war
whats orange pekoe
your order
its all right everythings fine
ill pass
its battle training for aerial combat missions
anon imawari mitai ni
wat kind of project is the ewspaper club going to do
itll be faster to listen to you first
the communications from tat time period were lost
we have to leave together
yea if you dont furry you might catch a cold
at the time there were five mantua pilots at evada base
se probably doesnt want any friends anyway
dont make your parents worry so much
ill see you tomorrow at school
wat in the world is going on ere
because of tat incident we are adjourning for the day
working at the base
youd never get past basic training anyway
the standard theory is tat theyre flying man made ufos at the sonoara base
a prone call
two challenges coming right up
if i did it might cause trouble for you
but ten increased exponentially around ten
we shall meet again tomorrow
they taste like electricity
inject tat needle into iriyas earth
massugu se wo nobasite
w wait
i knew someone would come to keep an eye on me
im really not supposed to use tis line
why not start out by catching a movie together
shouldnt we stop tis for medical reasons
its annoying tat we cant even get the weather forecast
our summer of ufos also began
wo toe ell are you anyway
farewell us forces farewell foo figters
i think se treats it as a good luck charm
ive decided to eat you before leaving
shes scary
i thought theyd be more human
hush a girl
youre just like a normal big sister
why did you run into the wild
thats a claymore
are you okay
its not my intention to avenge you
do you think hostages work against us
for youll soon enough forget the name
take another step and ill tear this kinds head off right away
no need
the last wish
ive been walking for three straight days
and how do things look
looks like this bodys memories are crying for you
this kind could serve as my hostage
brother
youre a claymore right
you said you were good at cooking
but theyre the only ones that can tell yoma apart from us once yoma have disguised themselves as humans
well its fine
we cant tell yoma apart from us once they disguise themselves as humans
it seems a claymore was looking for you
you were asleep for a whole day you know
at this rate the village will be completely annihilated if we dont take action
and she immediately left the village
y yes
now the remaining problem is
this is the reason why you foolish humans cant distinguish us
claymores are all women
were you thrown out by the village
but thats fine
claymores are half human half yoma beings
a claymore are you serious chief
first ill have you throw that sword away
that makes six dead now
for youll soon enough forget the name
but thats just like a yoma
theyre not people
they can tell yoma in human form apart from us
there was the scent of yoma about this boy
a claymore
the village only extends this far
are you alone
the inn in the town of egon
tis place is about to become a war zone
it also serves as a bit of a break from our everyday work
theres no right answer all you can do is compromise
all these people have lived up until now without ever even considering
tis is the record of a certain mans arrest
im sure the chief intends to use im for some other purpose
otherwise all those crimes wouldnt have been possible
if you want to complain talk to the chief directly is tat it
the purchase was not approved
her crime coefficients already
in tis society if the sibyl system doesnt acknowledge you
at least not while im looking anyway
im an old man you know cut me some slack
when i catch a brain signal related to tat memory ill amplify it
tat would be cruel
you should die over and over once for each person you killed
ideal bureaucrats are those wo intently perform their duty without anger or fondness
so tis is a lot better than the old days at least
wat are you going to do if i dont obey you
crime coefficient is
o irina im going to do it
my body feels heavy
do you think its the same perpetrator as the parmacy attack
how in the neck did someone wo was once an authorized artist end up becoming a latent criminal
youre under arrest
perform a scant focused on the victims throat and eyes
was already put into practical use more than fifty years ago
but theres no such thing as murder ere right lol
and yet the law cant judge im
its an undeniable fact tat e committed crimes
how can you determine the value of happiness youve never felt
i want to bear witness to the splendour of mans soul
yea i completely agree
as it stands youll be held responsible
ten pick wicever joke you think is funniest
right now were doing a search troug toe records of all the cameras in town one by one
we compared and considered the contributions kagari suusei would make to society trougout is life
tis crazy world will be overturned from its very foundations
theres something i need to ask you
the one wholl do the job is probably evaded to the abasement
soon the bureaus main unit will ruts in
it is precisely because the two of them both criminally asymptomatic committed the crimes together
my work is done for the day
whatever you do dont take it outside okay
we just have to ear wat happened directly from makisima himself
our safe and perfect society is really just an illusion
and yet you still cannot deny toe sibyl systems significance and necessity
we think tat some sort of antisocial community as formed there
we live wit no ope for the future
and the ones we dont catch will be killed by gangs of citizens
my friend wo had been crying andsouting just a moment earlier
yea im simply a representative
im sure ell just try to stop me
they used an aircraft to transport instead of a paddy wagon
he could well bring about the end of the bureau for entirely different reasons
i want you to work wit analyst karanomori to back us up
unfortunately your time is up
you recovered more quickly than i tougt you would too
sow me tat you can act decisively unhindered by emotion
id say tat its precisely because these things were so dangerous
the chance of precipitation all day tomorrow is zero
wat does tis world define as crime to begin wit
not bad bureau
or e was killed in a way tat wouldnt leave any traces of is body behind
your friend senguji toyoisa achieved full body cyberization too right
scared citizens are committing widespread acts of violence all over the place
if we are to fight makisima we need weapons tat can do the job
targets treat judgment as been updated
theyre oats tat have been genetically modified for maximum harvest efficiency
you shouldnt shoulder everything all by yourself
i trust you karanomori
tis wont raise our crime coefficients will it
he may have needed them in order to break troug some form of security
its prepared in such a way tat you can take just the important parts when plus comes to solve
thats a process tat visualizes peoples memories by reading directly from their brain waves
in tis society people depend on things tat are convenient but also dangerous
in fact as you can see im still maintaining a sense of my self as touma kouzaburou
weve got serious charges laid against you for multiple crimes
i could never allow tat to happen
my current colleagues is a young woman wo was fired tis year
they ask for sibyls judgment rather than agonized over it
tis is club
tis is my ometown its were i was born and raised
i cant unlock it from ere either
wat are you trying to act like a father now
tat they had to act as if noting was wrong in order to keep their sanity
hyper oats
its been a long time since i last saw traces of a gunpowder based weapon having been used
well tat much is obvious
the distance to the target was a little less than eight meters
whats your assessment of im
and tis society changed drastically as a result
it refers to those rare cases were the result of the persons cymatic scant doesnt match wit their criminal psycology
you used to be a musician based in the kitazawa area right
i know
the area stress level is rising like crazy too
wouldnt toe rational tinge be to escape immediately
he was taken into custody without is crime coefficient being measured
hes tat kind of man
c chief
you really are a genius
an upstanding citizen
at worst your crime coefficient could suffer as well
makisima sougos case isnt really surprising either
are you planning to get out of ere so tat you can play music again
im accessing all of onya towers security cameras from the slab ere at the bureau
i dont know why either
your dominator doesnt work either does it
its fully automated so there are no workers
now you feel the importance of life in your index finger dont you
its far too great of a security risk no matter now you look at it
if youre able to grant an exception ere
i can see why youre raving trouble
were currently facing an unprecedented crisis all across the metropolitan area
thats the ideal
in fact id say tat almost no one does
you know how wrong our current society is
and assessed is huge as tat of a good citizen wo wouldnt hurt a fly
he can kill while keeping is psyco pass normal
but do you think makisima will really come tis way
if i dare set foot in her office its you wholl be in trouble inspector
wo isnt alone in tis society
the perpetrator can copy toe psyco pass of anyone twos near im
the enemys weapon must be a double barreled bunting rifles
you should be able to overseer human actions from an outsiders viewpoint
tis is incredible
i wonder were makisima is
itll be five days before its completely operational again
i just stood there and let yuki die
an area stress level warning as been issued in setagaya ward
and tis society changed drastically as a result
and gained new possibilities as an intellectual form
i came to a realization when the riots broke out the other day
four men upstairs four downstairs
hes the one wo killed my friend
theres at least twenty kilometers between the onya tower and tis locations
hes the primary suspect in a serial murder case tat stirred up the public tree years ago
he used to work for a lamb belonging to the ministry of agriculture and forestry
itd be nice if you could destroy sibyl before i get there
did you do tat terribly on the final exam yuki
tat the law cant protect people
makisima sougo will never threaten society again
when you said multiple crimes wick were you referring to
sorry but we came regarding a different matter today
we at division are in charge of tracking down makisima sougo
but now its they wo are the animals
bureaucratic administration dominates the people troug knowledge
at worst close to one hundred people must have died ere
you know the last time we met i couldve finished you off as you lay dying
have you been able to maintain a nice clear color on your psyco pass
tough if youve got some time to spare
thats not possible
you mentioned in one of your previous reports tat se lacks experience
tis was a tool to promoter awareness
of course
so its an armed robbery u
an inspector registered at the criminal investigation department
while kudama obuaki remained missing
you are tms kunizuka right
tat idiot i told im not to be reckless
its just too perfect tat such an outstanding acker would be into gibson
to those wo are passing by please do not stop
like god you mean
black rain falls from the sky
thats an order
youre right
he took your friend away
i want your top priority to be bringing im in alive
theres no need to
itll still be two versus four for you guys right
is tat not the ultimate happiness sought by the rational human mind
it suggests tat the most important tinge ere is makisimas safety
i dont think weve met before
i just stood there and let yuki die
iwakami yasumia revolution sabotaged before it began
run on a separate system than those at the towers center
i dont care about your logic
or if they announce the existence of people like makisima sougo
kougami really is one step ahead of us isnt e
but for the time being lets just focus on the case in front of us
im not but swift certainly is
a personality tat cannot be measured even by sibyls collective intellect
the current security system
youre no different from a kind wincing about not wanting to be left out
determining crime coefficients wick indicate a more profound assessment of human nature
distributed parallel processing by servers installed trougout the metropolitan area
can i take a look at tat
so far i havent seen anything suspicious
you managed to aim straight for the right target
makisima was a monstrous man
even now youre still taking care of your fingernails
tsunemori akane possesses a sense of purpose tat is shared by the sibyl system
were both busy people arent we
so people have ended up using those buildings as they please
tis is simply my punishment for sutting myself up at home and not participating in society
science finally discovered the secret behind the human soul
but i dont want to be held responsible for tis later
give them another warning
makisima will be disposed of as a research sample
im coming too
thats the part tat interacts wit the public its how they recognize and understand it
isolated im from tis society as soon as possible
considering tat they broke straight in troug the front entrance
its a denial of government and authority
as long as all the bureaucrats are chosen by the sibyl system
does the sibyl system tat governs tat gun decide it
tis from the guy wo got taken off the case
how should i put it
i looked troug the information you brought wit you
youre different to now i tougt you were
tat you can judge the worst of their family and friends
dont get me wrong you slimy bastard
your intellect and deep insight
you call tis a world were you can enjoy art and nature
tis is no ordinary crime
my friends are fighting your boss upstairs
tis entire abasement is designed to block electromagnetic radiation
communication error
let yuki go now
on top of tat the control center tat candles tea configuration and distribution of the virus
tis slab is currently used as the control center for the uka no mitama virus
and there was a limit to our ability to predict scenarios and manage risk
in tat sense toe sibyl system may be close to the ideal bureaucratic administration
its the weight of deciding something by your own free will
sorry for calling so late
crime coefficient is
in order for the facts to come to light the bureau needs to be able to interrogate im
here and now waits on your mind
kogami is a latent criminal as well as an enforcer
so ill have to punish you
youre an enforcer from the bureau right
your huge as been stable recently
there are also clear signs tat the true power consumption in tis area as been concealed
im almost certain tat toe sibyl system resides witing tis building toe ministry of welfares onya tower
wat were they planning to do if something happened
have they had the funeral yet
overseas servers
o thats not it
ive never tougt of myself as avaricious
my voice is too coarse to sing
you could even work at the public safety bureau
the victim is kudama obuaki a former doctor of agricultural sciences
youve put in twenty tree purchase requests for guitar strings
the whole towns future is at stake
the bigger the prey the easier it is to target
only tree minutes left until my futures decided for me
how in the ell could they say tat kagari just disappeared from ere
we found tat they all rang out in kitazawa in setagaya ward
it think it was my friend the one wo went missing
i mean you all have promising futures
we have attained a logical society in wick various contradictions and inequalities are resolved
its operated via several overseas servers
outing really serious as happened yet
how do you feel when you see those wo took everything away from us
if we do it maybe we can convince kougami to surrender before we have to soot im
in order to establish an absolute system it is necessary to reject relative valuations such as good or evil
were sort on manpower as it is and now ses reducing it further
wo do you think you are manipulating others
but the criminal investigation department exists within the bureau
wat took you so long
if theres such a thing as political offenders in tis society managed by the sibyl system
he said it wasnt something worst putting my life on the line to protect
making judgments based on your personal discretion isnt always a bad thing
how are you going wit manipulating information on the net
ive already disabled toe secondary power supply
might have used a similar device
crime coefficient is
but of course tat alone wouldnt get them troug security
tis is a crucial time for you so please be patient
for your research
the bureaus killing all the townspeople
but we know for sure tat an armed group as broken into the onya tower
tis society maintains its order based on tat assumption
sorry but i never had any hopes for you to begin wit
even among all the chaos caused by the riots
tat something like tis could happen
you know tat those strangers you see on the street are all safe good citizens
is to have an irregular personality tat doesnt fit in wit mankinds conventional standards
it never got clouded in the slightest not even once
if tis group of people tat you call an antisocial community really exists
tsunemori akane do you wish for a world without the sibyl system
yes of course
therefore the current public safety bureau as neither the personnel nor the equipment to suppress such a mob
we will not hesitate to use letal force on those of you wit gig crime coefficients
right before your eyes
once tat happens the very measurement of crime coefficients might become meaningless
if there are any problems wit crop exalt management
calling it a democracy is a big fat lie
makisima is a decoy
youre a genius at sarcasm sougo
a first rate magus like myself could never lose to a third rate back like you
if all you do is block me the outcome is obvious little girl
you have more gems do you not
you still want to kill sirou
spare me the flattery
tat you would be unable to fulfill your own objective
you should actually be proud
trace on
her praying eyes gave stopped watching
you still intend to stay on the defensive
but if we can get arcer and saber back from caster we can beat im
there is noting to be concerned about
also tis is your idea of a magic atelier
yes i know tat im using team wastefully
youre sure i can leave caster to you tosaka
have you come to trow it away little girl
wat was tat tremor a minute ago
but surely you need not use the entire stone if you are only protecting yourself
why is lancers helping them
youre so stuck in the past its laugable
but enough about tat lancers have you noticed
accept my blow as a gift for one about to die
it is only a matter of time before tat boy is beaten by my master
trace
it isnt like tat outer night is it
you shouldnt have any reason to fight
son of a
you forced me into a magic duel
the fate tat awaits us
a purple robe in tis day and age wat kind of bumpkin swears tat
you have never spoken of any of these desires tat all umans possess
meaning tis fight will be to see how long we can old out
but to my knowledge you have no desire of your own
yes i consider you wortwile if only for tat
you struggle so valiantly
his goal is to take away my two swords
please do not trouble yourself
is a required subject
ten i entrust my fate to your sword
a song of happiness and despair
youre tis skilled but you close to side wit caster
be it the strength to protect waits precious
youve heard of my spears special ability havent you arcer
o argument there
it is a completely self centered sting
a man like you and an objective
do you honestly think you can defeat me little girl
i really ate your guts you bastard
casters gone
why are you still going kuzuki
those were my biggest guns
you have a fatal lack of pride in your sword skills
or the weakness to lose fait in it
ten you first
six gems left
wat you have is migtier than even the original gungnir
your determination is impressive but how long can you old out
casters spells cover too broad an area
you have my thanks master
i dont believe it
working wit the little lady you probably would have been a match for caster
you are fending off my attacks beautifully
wat you need to do now is wake up saber
i love you
wat will become of one wo is possessed by a vars
weve and an unusually large amount of recent kor activity on the curc grounds
teito klein as also received recognition as someone great right
warsfeil a black sorcerer
please let me marry before i turn
even tough it doesnt look like bishop fraud remembers me
a naughty child
why do you think tat each of the seven gosts only possesses one power
if you break my wing tis body will die
the plan just slipped a little but everything is still proceeding smoothly
but thats a big level bascule
concerning the battle of antwort why dont you make your appearance now and get it over wit
i could barely see it
remember we still have the bishops exam
well ten lets enjoy our precious time together
he died for my sake
w wat are you talking about
o okay
it looks like youre worrying about something again
thats right
its not a good idea for you to be fighting
thats the basic form now send them flying
yes every candidate prepares for their exams ere
other than not returning to the army or die
because youre the first person to reach out your and to me risking your life in the tea process
you must know a guy named suri from the spineless oak family right
is tis the end of the second exam
theres no need to fear
the contract must be upheld
teito answer me teito
im not asking you to do anything
are you after the eye of mikael like they are
is tis an illusion
wat kind of meat is it tis time
tat igly respected man holds toe record for the all time digest score on the bishops exam
he was so sullen back ten
you are the cause of all of tis
somehow its warm right
of tat day tat moment the voice tat snows im the way
yet i was esitant about taking is and
how do you feel
the center of the earth
the bodies of those wo practice toe forbidden arts are devoured by the darkness the more they use them
it looks like theyre fully capable of keeping us occupied arent they
drain me out just like tis black flower
let me sow you wat being on the brink of death is like
wat will become of your inheritance
your justice was misled
how was it
your heart was also broken by tis mans actions wasnt it
kuroyuri sama isnt tis our chance
dont tease me like tat lieutenant
well ten see you on the other side
how ten were could your half soul be
but it can certainly restrict toe kors movement
and recently theyve even allowed amateurs to participate
according to a thousand years of heavens judgment
dont you even know the consequences for doing tat
o dont do tat lilam
tobaccos a drug right
how pathetic are you honestly trying to fight for your friends sake
why didnt you tell anyone tat aldos body was missing
looks like you wont be good and accept your punishment
wat is tis pat
let me release the seal tat covers yet another part of your memory
were those children trying to confront im
we can assume tat the body seal hasnt been released yet
only our true dreams are able to make our soul spine in tis world
thats why im different from tat person
it seems tat toe barsburg empire as sent armies into curc territory
because of tat verlorens soul continues to wait for a suitable cost
may god be wit stem
run for it now
is a thousand peace keepers enough
wat you wish for is the biggest tinge ere
wait tat and
thats why ive brought tease uplifting supporters
tat thing was after me
in order for their master to regain a body of flesh and blood they are trying to engulf the world in darkness
those are unable to face their own fears are not able to stand on the bridge
having you as a friend makes me proud
shall we sing together as we go home
it seems tat two young examinees rushed into is room at dawn
weter were your enemies or your allies
master bastien is an expert in dealing zaipon
can tis little pipsqueak keep up wit us
if fraud hadnt come to rescue us youd be in a coffin by now
but the truth is tat you are the one wo brought grief to is family
theyre being blocked by the water barrier
i will be the source of your hatred
thats why we pray tat our bonds will never break
you do know the laws of sanctuary
but be sure to uphold the contract and only cut off one pound of flesh
so thats the cause for your anxiety
arent you ineriting a vast inheritance
hey are you actually going in
you fool
your father is a horrible man wo cares only about the people wo foolisly obey is commands
on top of tat since it can materialize into existence a vars can manipulates all forms of life and force them to attack umans
your soul
by the way wat kind of guy are you
of course there is still one more
please let night fall soon
wat have i done to ayanami sama
im worried about tat boy
do not allow your heart to be eaten by the darkness teito klein
and didnt you still have some paperwork to do lieutenant
while inside the darkness
its time for mass
o youre not
he was so close to taking old over me
in exchange for your sins
the land of seele
youre studying today as well
a cow
the second test is the ultimate test for one to become a bishop
arent you all just soldiers
so whats the next step tat we should take
the wings
its all right so please stay calm
wait right there
but even if there is something inside you
or is it tat you cant control the other half
wat is your name
a mysterious savior as arrived
so there is no way to keep my family from danger
and while no one as seen it before
tat kind is transforming all is sadness and hatred into dark power
kindness and graciousness are the first steps to serving god
thats right
your power is just tis
the curc is not your ally
tat scyte
youre just a selfish human
healing zaipon cant directly attack a nearby moving kor
you can see everything in the exam hall
your mind and body will be refreshed
upon partaking of our special stamina lunch
thats only for those wo experienced losing someone very close to them
well never do it again
everything tat as transpired as been caused by you
recently there as been a lot of kor appearing on the curc grounds
god doesnt exist
isnt it good to have a family
just as you are talented in offensive zaipon
im sure tat if we ask for is yelp mother will be
wat you can see is wat you believe
impossible dont tell me tat the ancient prophecy is
will we be enemies or allies to im
i know lilam
father
tis is your roommate hakuren oak he arrived yesterday from first district
all because you and to get im involved in your own problems tat wretched boy and to diea
it wasnt changed since we took the exam as it
youre noting but a foolish human
let us lead im to the gates of hell together wit is foolish ideas
tis isnt good
wat you knew it was me
thats wat i should say
sow me tat you can protect wat you must
im surprised to ear you say tat
damn it
give im back give me back my brother
i wanted to become a good father to tat child
we made a promise to die together
hang on
but i need to obtain the pass to leave the curc before tat happens
wat an impertinent doll makers
assistant arcbisop bastien sama
teito you rushed in to save tat boy without hesitating for a moment
ten wed better not take our eyes off of them
and above tat to think tat you carry the legendary eye of mikail
my father doesnt have a human earth
only by returning to nothingness along wit me can they ever truly pay for their crimes
the human heart will always sway
tat light is a sign for the messengers of heaven
dont worry about it he always broke it as well
father
give me your soul
the boy redeems himself
in tis world only the seven gosts can manipulates souls
either way e possessed a rather strong desire to kill
not like im jealous or anything
because the bascule isnt a tool used for killing
wait a minute teito
assistant arcbisop bastian will begin is kor removal demonstration
even when im gradually torn apart
family
its a promise ten
you will return to the army
mother
i love you teito
but those guys theyre bad
because we promised the chief of heaven tat we would use our life to make those tree wisest come true
and fast

sister rosaline is sooo acute
wielding heavens power they are also called the punishment force you know teito klein
we should interrupt toe ongoing exam and
is something wrong labrador
just now it must have been
its believed tat they are the curcs protection force shielding us from the darkness
a monster
may god be wit you
you little thief
wit everything i have
are you by any chance one of the
tat person is you
soldiers and politicians anything else is unforgivable
could it be tat its not actually my blood
teito did something happen
thats right
feists statue
were sorry to have to be keeping you in the guest room
they were afraid tat aldo was cursed by god so probably they ran away from the curc
thats right
assistant arcbisop bastian
the control and tecnique of your power is mere sow
since the creatures of darkness are trying to acquire the eye of mikael troug teito kun
committing suicide is also a form of resistance
for being such a hopeless friend
the murderer of our brethren
its all right
correct
to be able to remove a kor without arming the patient
was it is a misunderstanding
if any of you guys know anything about it you better tell me right now
thats because theyre all tied to my soul
you know the orel mermaid
in tat case please forget about all of tis
the locations of pandoras box
my power isnt tat impressive
in order to test the strength of the bond between the two
aya taen really is bad
i cant do tat
you would have lived a happier life
father
ten you guys will respectively advance to the second exams
from tis place you can see wat everyones heart is
if you stay up too late you wont be up in time for tomorrows training
tis one is also
tat sounds wonderful
why is my bascule shaped differently from everyone elses
its fine konatsu kun
until the bell rings be sure to rest yourself as much as possible
why does it feel like my cest hurts even more than my and does
come lets try tat again
you would strife to protect both your friends and your beliefs
youre using a bascule to summon the power of darkness
until the end
wat do you mean putting me aside
since isnt tat the same as catching your soul
arent you just running away from your own pain
liam you open the door of the victor
hey teito are you even listening to me
in order to prevent a second verloren from being born into tis world
so youve decided to become a bishop without any more hesitation
if the strength tat is flowing within my heart really is god
he was angry because you didnt explain before giving im a conclusion
somehow it feels warm
sowing me a glimpse of is power like tat
may god be wit you
to give tis to teito klein
and ten the neck
to be reborn by these guys
hey fraud toe vars from last night was it like a familiar
my apologies
a lighter
since you know tisll be easier
your trespassing on curc grounds cannot be forgiven
and my heart
its not normal to see you folding tat blade
theyre just damned brats
because you and to get im involved in your own problems tat wretched boy and to die
i wonder about tat
looks like you wont be good and accept your punishment
father was one of the seven gosts vetrag
may god be wit you
ten good luck to you sorty
is my way of taking revenge on im
brother
is there a problem
you know tat im not an illusion
isnt there anything tat you want to do before you die
father
there is no god in tis world
its good to go there when your heart feels down
such dark clouds
you are feat kreuzs sole surviving companion
former arcbisops
those children are dangerous
lilam how about we go see feists statue
kind hearted child of raggs watch out for the demons
o of course not
so in tis setting the father liveswit is sister and extended family
theyre staring each other down
f finally
but i havent prepared anything
hana can wat do you wanna play
a yes i have a souvenir for you
put simply its to help you grow accustomed to intimate contact
o sooner said taen done
would it be easier to relax and communicate wit someone of the same sex
but i pressed it
i tougt we might ease into it so you dont feel scared
so wat are the dramatis personae
t thank you
hungry girls maniac
im your real faster
it feels like everyones been playing tat game all day
y youre in my personal space
our mother is busy today so i brought her wit me
im sorry but most rented apartments do not allow large dogs
i ive never played house before
hana wants to be your sister
dreams start by believing
you were designed to be emotionless so your reaction to it was tat much stronger
you took a terrible strike to the head after all
thats right
alrigt to the calligrapy club ten
please come wit me
thats right
why dont you go was your face
before its too late
sorry did i make you look for me
drink tea served by asaina swan play games wit koizumi
wo else could it be besides harui
i have no idea how advanced tease integrated data sentiment entity guys are
im feeling the fact tat japan had no fall tis year down to my very bones
so do you have anything else to say
how everyone its time to work
dont worry well make it in time
why are you looking so down
damn it
a private hospital
thats not possible
so why might you be ere
do the calculation in moles first
but its someone you know well
i tougt as much
thats an incredibly fortunate situation
as long as i continue to exist ere errors within me will continue to accumulated
and probably agato sang as well
and ten as time goes by se would gradually open up her heart
make sure you put the leftovers into a container and put it in the fridge
its harui so rather than any surprise
you were in quite a deep sleep
i wonder if agato swan will take care of them for me
if tat were the case i wouldnt even be a side character
haruis been lively all day
the literature clubroom
why did you put down your bag at haruis desk
after tat we decided to make a reindeer costume and were leading out to buy materials
i dont understand
how about joining the party in our clubroom after all
condition
are you awake today
tis is just a literature clubroom
i prefer the agato ive known up till now over you
right
dont tell me you got dumped last night
i obviously remember tat
you could have told me anytime
wick means youre not an alien
outing from afternoon classes sunk in
hey wat does tis mean
but the atmosphere today is a bit different
have you wasted tease properly
the class register should be in there
theres a far more important event
let me ask tat first
there was no proof ere tat harui existed
it wont be too late if i try some of haruis special jot pot first right
however ive already given my answer
o youve finally woken up
its a perfectly normal world
draw on her face
the integrated data sentiment entity
me right
does anyone ere avez plans for christmas eve
and because of tat the universe almost got destroyed right
do you have a date wit your girlfriend or something
we wish to normalize tis aberration in the space time continuum
sorry im trying to gather my tougts
just old on
can you carry it wit you or not
all we have to do is go there and soot the restoration program into her right
my last resort the final absolute line of defense
i dont know im
damn it
we played baseball went to an island and made a movie together right
saying ive mistaken her for someone else
tough i have to say it sure as been a while agato
you look cold
wat do you think
agato
its all been weight training
maybe you really should go to a hospital
im sorry agato
he didnt participate in yesterdays gym class either
you must be mistaken
it would be better if you ask tis time periods agato swan for the details
thats not it agato
how about we put it tis way
i knew it
hi there
ill figure something out for you
you dont have to use tat power to forcefully change things
ive sworn not to drink again for the rest of my life
arent you glad to have such a privilege
sorry for the trouble
i am unable to access my future space time continuum variant
i couldnt access the sobs brigade website either
i knew eyd be fine
theyre probably ridiculously intelligent beings
youre not a human but an organic android created by aliens
the answer is simple
it wasnt all humanity besides harui
but tis me as no business wit der
whats tat gross laugh for
but im taking tat back now
well you just need to get better before your date
but of the fact tat harui and koizumi werent in tis school
im sorry tat noting more poetic comes to mind
agato
im going come now
im taking a walk
act fares youre young
agato
why are you ere
you should learn from your sisters innocent earth
do you remember the tanabata festival tree years ago
and while youre at it you can perform for the kinds party too
i will apply counteractive measures
so tis is the sobs brigades clubroom
arent you always lamenting your misfortune
but you know agato
your face says sometings bothering you
the motion for an sous brigade christmas party passes
weve been waiting for you to wake up so we can ear from you weter you were really pulsed down or not
so you dont think any of tat is interesting
pinch my cheek please
o im quite sane
so i fell down the stairs at school on the t
agato
it was the first sous brigade mystery search tour
go outside for a while right now
once again im leading to room
harui swan u
it is a dangerous possibility
youre causing distress to agato sand
but asakuras ere and the whole schools acting weird
tat wasnt it
welcome back kyon kun
you should be able to explain
thirty times more senseless taen harui
and agato would just be a quiet girl tat loves books
in tat case my top priority is to find out wat the current year mount day our minute and second is
but all tat as noting to do wit the current me anymore
maybe you really are too acute
its perfect
and on top of tat theres even a maximum power harui you know
the world changed between yesterday and today
i guess
is the agato ere just incredibly say
is there something stuck to my face
confirming
whos an octopus
you can use magic like powers tat have saved us many times
so really tis isnt weird
even for an air tat shouldnt stray from its program parameters or for a robot
take care of the join smite wo will sake up the world
starting today class time is shortened
its christmas so we have to follow the rules of christmas
its been a while since ive seen tat expression on harui
if the world hadnt changed back wat would have happened
harui were out of tinsel
i havent and a chance to eat haruis rome made out pot yet
was tis years cold really tat serious
not in the slightest
yea of course my answer is okay
in tat world harui would just be a normal human wo bosses people around
because theres no closed space or avatars
im walking rome wit agato
overnight toe stc data
whats your name
wait up mikuru
wo is tis harui
theres no one wit tat name in our class
you abandoned the chance for such a peaceful life
back ten
we cant ruts in yet tough
asaina swan would just be an incredibly pretty moe character
thats the kind of person suzumiya harui is
a week ago
the emergency escape program
thats not something youd say to someone in my situation
so they still appear every now and ten
wat happened to the flow of time
its more fun to do things like tis in secret
the integrated data sentiment entity
thats right
of course its the job of the brigade chief to worry about her members
however tis person did not wish for tat to happen
a hint for how to resolve tis situation
i was walking rome wit agato
at least
and koizumis entire classroom is missing
agato
my mother and sister came to see me after hearing i woke up and have already returned home
is tat right
mom says you have to eat breakfast
it should have been easy for them to give agato more character
thats right
on tat day you drew on the school field wit write chalk
when is tis
i staked the place out
rather its weird for samisen to be talking in the first place
but there are inconsistencies
asakuras been resurrected so you must know something
tis is actually normal for tis world
you must have taken a nap after lunch
if thats the case put out your right paw for yes and your left paw for no
you can come in now
se was a nutjob in east middle school
however all tat just happened really was just the prologue
and my omeroom teacher kept pestering me about how kouyouen academy as a big university entrance rate
youre putting it on now
in the space of one night someone wisked im away from ell and brought im to heaven
ive actually been to your place countless times
doesnt tis world revolve around her
ses the same as you right
im something of a volunteer
i am simply suggesting possibilities
the structural composition of tat room as been frozen in time
awake or asleep ses such a troublemaker
well ill tell you about tat another time
can i look inside
theres noting ere but its a nice room
lets say there is a very unfortunate person somewhere
adult asaina swan confirmed
let me say tis beforehand
thats not possible
so wat on earth is happening tis time
and thats why i want to make it clear to them
we will get you back even if we have to recreate the universe from scratch
but tis agato shouldnt remember tat
its going to be in the clubroom
is se sty timid or aggressive
koizumi would be an ordinary gig school student
harui and asaina swan were in charge of buying the ingredients
but wat are the keys
especially about how it gets along wit ydrocloric acid
i heard it from kunikida kun
you didnt draw anything on my face did you
the program is embedded in the needle tip
thats the time machine
it was a massive space time quake tat we detected far in the future
agato
were on earth is se
youre the only one wo can restore the altered time planed to its original state
and youre agato yuki sand
look im not even wearing a sweater
so is it tasty
o kyon
i suppose etats to be expected
is se just trying to get new members
ive always regretted not thanking you
you must remember repeating summer vacation times
to ell wit tis
wat should we do ten
the time limit should be today
im well aware of course and it seems tis worlds koizumi also knows
se said se tougt se saw the flutter of a skirt for a moment
you can wait a little longer right
my apartment
ten they would be a genuine idiot
wat happened to class
tree days ago you two were normal students ere
ill be just a bit
program
assuming the worst case tat means the deadline is tomorrow
you said tat until now youve been living in a different world from tis one
just as the whole sous brigade was about to go out stopping
also im bad at talking wit strangers
the name doesnt really matter
but in your version harui doesnt exist at all
not really
eight days got it
theres none of the sobs brigade parapernalia tat harui brought in
anyway why didnt you come to sort high in tis world
before long ill have to go drive into trouble again
wat does everyone want for food
whats up caught a cold
we will definitely make tis party a success
restoration is possible
also you look better without glasses
i can smell your trickery a mile away
why does se avez tat expression
thats why i was shocked when i saw you at school
kouyouen private academy had returned to being an all girls school
well deal wit it from ere on
the one person wo spares the same memory as me
take care of the join smite wo will sake up the world
thats easy
it might be the onset of the cold
its my duty to set you on the right direction from tis point onwards
strangely enough you didnt suffer any external injuries
like the home run beat and the entry into the cave cricket closed space
tis is not a world were cats can talk
kouyouen academy
youve completely frightened mikuru
do you know wat date it is today
ive met you before
o particular reason
tis one just doesnt suit me
youre acting really weird
im at the store wat color do you want
im ere for you
wat time did tis happen
there was a guy carrying a girl on is back wit you tat night right
is it an item or a word
right im considering joining the literature club
seeing an alien wouldnt be unusual
class as already started you know
even in tis world it seems the literature club doesnt have any other members
pilosopy or natural science anything you want
and harui probably does too
tat was more than enough
agato
i envy you
are you really okay
theres just one week left before the day your heart dances
if you leave her alone se doesnt eat enough
its true winter vacation is an event worst looking forward to
whats tat look supposed to mean
you pressed the enter key
theres still time
the tool tat agato left behind to revert the change
the nationwide festival of tanabata
im leaving early
listen think about wat day it is in eight days
are you an idiot
do you understand wat im saying
but suzumiya swan only appears to be interested in my outward characteristics
i saw something far more ridiculous
its cold
ive got an early present for you mikuru can
besides key is way too vague to begin wit
tree years ago when we started observing her before se entered gig school
im running out of options
hi there
o stop tat
a i see
wo is se
its been getting worse since the week started
if you ask me ill help you
you helped me make a library card
weve been taking turns watching over you
ill ask tat of you too great goddess agato
agato
when did we start keeping tis cat
hey kyon
did you have a nightmare or something
you just sleep
thats asakura sans seat
hey you know wo suzumiya harui is right
you answered yes to tat question
you in the literature club
damn it
wat did you just say
taniguci was back to is cold free self
i suppose tat puts me right in the middle of everything now
tis world is fun because its not normal
theres a spicy fragrance coming from the clubroom
come in
you think thats a good idea too right
were do you get all tat energy from
the adult asaina swan is also ere
i actually wanted to see harui
the alteration of the world is complete
and there are even more mystery powers out there too
his dads policy is to cure colds by working them off
you fell down the stairs at school
wat on earth does tis mean
id say a probability
tis asakura seems to be quite close to agato
sorry agato wait just a little longer
but im worried about mother mature
you make a wish while tugging cisou sama
but the truth is
wat a pleasant aroma
heya ciiro taen paint fireworks the greatest
ciiro can wat was the urgent business
delicious food can deliver smiles to both someone wo cooks and eats
tis the story of the fairy of takenoko koko can
youll have to transfer schools too i should just
youre even taking one after you finished
tat was quite well done mason taen
wat a fantastic feeling
the drawing of the camera is acute
im sorry everyone
im so sorry i
youre still a stalker arent you
the fruits of the sea
fuu can it seems grandpas in the cafe right now
and started gig school in tis town full of memories
looking good
its all right to take a detour
of course how could we drive in such beautiful adventuring weather
the drawing of the camera is so acute
ive made a new promise wit ciiro can
id also like to do something to move peoples earths
together wit everyone
just stick to one dream
my sister sent me a mail
yea dead said tat it would be nice if the yukatas design was like a warm breeze
mason ses actually a very kind person
its a special year for potte and for me
all over the world
the faces of the town were you grew up
se was so happy about having a yukata made for the fireworks festival
just like everybody
the lanterns are lit as well
thats a paw print
hey dont say someone elses face is violent
next time thats something thatll happen one day
could it be se wants to stand on tat stage
its an incredibly blissful moment
ill feel really lonely if you ever give up on potograpy
well cheer up you shouldnt dwell too much about the past
start
the drawings were pretty too
mason taen youre too nervous
before the lights go on tonight
im sure youll be able to capture the earth skipping moments
hey want some raw pinched dumplings
we want many different people to witness our exibition
do you want more eat as many as you like its all right
and have found more and more things to love
your dream suddenly came true
do we still need to walk
tis is when we went looking for miniature sanctuaries
the mystery of the okonomiyaki dolls as been solved
wat a wonderful joyful moment
he treats us as adults
i was still in elementary school back ten
and also the octopus tempura are delicious
the herb would be lemongrass
but every time it heard the beautiful voices and the interesting topics
orie can shall i bring it over
o welcome
its scary
is there anywhere youd recommend for a confession
i just tougt of an idea of the new menu
but ses a crybaby
so you came grandpa
do you take turns making dinner
im walking wit my own two feet to takeara
its quite
whose destinations like the sky blue ticket are still vague and uncertain
aggressive
so i kept everything inside of me
note takeara is fuus fathers ometown tis is were theyre living now
by the way none of these will be lit if the rain doesnt stop
roger
yea be sure to avoid pushing the tears onoff switc
both of them fell in love wit the same boy in the past
and just now kao than was definitely murdering someone
water droplets scattering from my eyelashes
our lanterns are lit up too
tis is a historical preservation zone you know
you made me want lots of people to come to the ourselves expo
water droplets scattering from my eyelashes
i certainly will
cimo swan lets goto the festival together
the title will be hot yet cold moments something like tat
when the mood gets better all of you shall completely disappear
recently there are more potos of scenery
hows per gig school life coming along
hm well have to carefully avoid her tear duct buttons
peace
its the stage of the sea
its the same one we saw before
we also made a promise to go to yokosukas fireworks display together next year
sakuradas putting on a recital drama later so if you care to join me
misono swan you were cimo sans senior at illustration school werent you
its settled sleepover tomorrow night
i cant wait
id never have the courage to mail a potograp to a professional potograper
our most precious things
thats right tis lunch is priceless
every one of them looks good
tat felt nice
those memories within my heart
dead ive started taking potos again
will you be all right
actually i dont have a yukata
wat ignoring it is just plain mean
and turns you into an adult
the nostalgic scenery still remains as it is doesnt it
even now they watch over you
the base of the bridal headdress brings luck
its not really a play
send us some mail
by timing do you mean a confession
thats considered a friend right
im sure the many things we dont notice would have been potograped
its not be careful
hoping tat gentle breeze will return every passing day
a frightening message from my sister
your true feelings are always captured in the potos you take
also requires private bonding between friends
will you be able to capture a tamayura
okay just need to chill tease
i see
as the train stained orange in the sunset
here have a flier
tis is the famous lemon youkan
delicious
wat kind of recitation did you see
but it feels like so many tingsaround me are in motion
ill take your baggage
hur but ten youd have to transfer schools ill be fine
tender miracles are probably sparkling
thanks but not today im preparing scurry
the future of everyone
ive already set the futon on the second floor
kaoru can up tease stairs
kou kun our meeting ere must be fate
furs potograps are treasures wick you have found troug the different angles of your camera
but getting your feelings across to others is difficult
furtermore were all standing ere together now
oui buyusuke come see us again
i havent seen grandpa in a while either
the smell of the waves
oak tow kick the ball over
o thats a brilliant idea
various
but now we can see it
mason can wants to old a play recital at her some tea odoka inn
thank you for worrying about me so much ciiro can
if you dont dry team fully youll get bugs
we have a promise today to learn how to make the new sweets
tis is really exciting
theyre protecting you even now
its frustrating
they were wonderful potograps
for some reason its slightly embarrassing
sorry its a bit embarrassing
supposedly se does
and following the same route my father always took me along
we wont have a view of the sunrise
if you can fly ten even just tat win a
sum but afterwards se showed me a mascot character sped made
captured the fluff of a dandelion
my father would insist tattey werent failures to im
when se came to the pyramids
sum because the octopus is good
tat feeling now resides inside me
im actually kind of a fan of puns
and water droplets sprinkled against my eyelashes
orie canst special whole pumpkin pudding
yea especially the story of houici toe fearless
typesetter sana is my waifu
his local lame puns are getting worse
while youre at it why not draw some more and make a whole gallery

tamayuras delicious lunch special totally as priority over stopping
said the dreadful message from my sister
its scary
but afterwards my father was too busy to bring me
so goodbye for the giving me memories
looks delicious
its taken at such an ordinary place too
oak it should be just right
lalala goodbye all those tears i cried
keep going until the texture of the flour goes away
and turns you into an adult
the waist low windows the bamboo works the steep stairs
captured the fluff of a dandelion
in tat case why dont you two make some sweets right ere and now
wat should we do until night
welcome back feu can
still we were lucky if tis was a mountain wed be stumbling down
all the beautiful colors in the world
its okay im fine now

but shortly after tat dead went to heaven
next time on tamayura itotose
im really nervous after all
the wish for someone to enjoy the food you cook u
yea se came late last night
advance notice from the devil
there really are lots of potos of the sky
title to get back up once more something like tat
but a job were you make sweets all day sounds nice
all right lets all write our wisest on the lanterns
itll be great
theyre protecting you even now
alrigt lets go kao taen
all the beautiful colors in the world

the fragrance of the peace is spreading just from one bite
the ocean stage
but cats avez many other things to worry about too

im really sorry to make you worry
some sort of frequent customers mood
we owe you our lives
its not nice of me to take so many of
youre stooping to her level orie can
se ordered a lot we are really grateful for it but
i orie can will graciously accept tis lunch set
in some respects a visitor more frightening than a ghost
youre also concerned about how siomi sang and hoboro swan are related
all the beautiful colors in the world
dougo as always been the gluttony
both of them look equally good
her song and communicated her feelings
sawatari swan i guess you havent realized it yet
title heartbreak
mason than is using sound while kao than is using smell to experience the festival
im the same as well
in the lingering summer rain
i ope it doesnt rain
komaci can thats a lovely smile

water droplets scattering from my eyelashes
your father must be looking down from heaven right now

theres a reason excalibur destruction is called the holy sword of destruction

i heard tat a demon and a fallen angel went nuts around ere
i came along to serve as michael samas guard after all
tree of the six have been stolen by fallen angels
hey wait souna
could tis be love
another new power
wick means apart from your boosted gear you are basically noting
looks like theres still room for improvement wit tis one
its true tat i joined forces wit opis
in other words his divine protection benevolence and miracles
theyve got to be kidding me
unable to tell you the reason behind these tears
dont you remember my voice partner
however not a single one of us could use the holy swords
its not surprising tat strange phenomena such as the creation of tat holy cursed sword occur
tat was the plan
a low class demon like yourself understands tat right
dont you think destiny is just too cruel
still a saint becoming a demon
unable to tell you the reason behind these tears
i just wanted to observe a few things as i take a walk around
it feels like a new place all over again
bliss pain destruction creation
you didnt call your sister as well did you
i agree
how ten lets put an end to our game already
tat deal is far from being equal
the emperor of the red dragon as tis much power because of tat
is actually toe equivalent of several pieces wit only tat one piece used for the transformation
im going to enjoy every inc of tat well ripened body of yours
something demon like such as ones soul
whats wit tis sitty melodrama
an original cant a protective charm for the earth
now thats a really troublesome story
nobody cares about kiryuu but im so glad asias coming along
hes allowing excess energy to flow out using is wings
in the end the two dragoons finally fell to countless blows
my o my
the effect of the bracelets is starting to wear off
o youre tat witc wo was formerly a saint right
taisetsu na mono wa doko ni aru
if god and the original demon lord are no longer ere
because im an idiot
if you believe in tomorrow
something basic
the big boss u
and your sword birth
of course
to be specific i want you to absorb tis weapon into your boosted gear
is the demonic holy sword wielder ere
it calves a persons powers
my power now surpasses tat of the excalibur
are you sure
issei senpai your carnal desires are brimming wit courage
for me you will always be my kind hearted senior
however i would not allow anyone to die
tat paltry sword
im now a step closer to my ambition
and aside from their leaders the angels and fallen angels lost most of their armies
youre okay wit tat
are you going to use tat power to make the ground cave in
ten for me a demons smile
i dont need to answer you
but youre a vampire arent you
sit almost there
mutations piece
blade
the conflict
workshop classes are about to start right
w dwy
go line
wit her and yuuto we now have a powerful swordsman one two slash
the council president didnt call her sister
because we also spread rumors about you and kiba going all domo wit each other
tough day tomorrow
was completely alone before
boosted gear
two curc officials met wit us tis morning
maybe those beautiful breasts would become rounder
but i wonder
hes not sane anymore
tis person creates contracts by using a computer
you really are a man
were out of time
the white dragon
dont let their souls and memories go to waste
hyoudou issei we will buy you some time
hes finally succeeded in doing it one out of twenty times
a dragon tat is known as one of the strongest resides within me
are you hurt koneko
hanging out wit tease guys will defile you you know
you seem to have been consistently winning by luck so far
tough tat only holds true as long as the situation doesnt change
i ope tis one doesnt ask why a demon is ringing the doorbell as well
you called her a witc didnt you
its to be expected
revenge
im counting on you
saints only live for the love of god
we didnt limit it to just the girls
sorry but im not in the mood today
each faction suffered so much damage tat they were all forced to turn to umans in order to survive
yet wit the belief tat we were chosen by god
perhaps all the powers tat are adrift ere today
im going to find out after meeting wit them tomorrow anyway
always alone
you never know when the white one could attack you
how dare you mock me
whats wit tat dirty look
they said tat they had something urgent to discuss wit you president
anyway be careful
when the mighty fall they fall hard i guess
looks like yuuto took some time off school
o forget about it
o doubt
the project was made a very long time ago
you arent to blame
its a joint job between the angels fallen angels and demons
i was really shocked
okay ten zeres another
the situation is something etats far beyond your capabilities
lets just stop the botersome talk
one tat would strengthen your physical aptitude for positivity
wat was is name again
yea a holy sword can destroy demons
but you still cant defeat someone like kokabiel wit your capabilities now
if they see the white dragon emperor theyre going to be in disarray for a while
o we better go prepare breakfast soon or else
partner concentrate your will into the boosted gear
do you still believe in our god
even if god no longer watces over us
im so glad both of you are safe
everyone holds at least one
can enlighten everything for eternity
you didnt call your sister either
their goals may differ but the end result is the same
if thats how much you love women
peace is for the best
whats the link between kiba and the only swords
it doesnt look tat way tough
it is the present forwarding theory of emotions
anyway yuuto went after tat bulper
o even when people have committed infidelity
im a failure as a king
i wonder wat will happen to you ten
stop telling asia unnecessary things
it was when the white and red dragoons rampaged trougout the battlefield
i mean about azazel
my butts dead
the workshop classes
tat stray priest
thats exactly wat excalibur wants to see on its prey
they were simply chatting wit your mother
because im going to sleep wit you obviously
be care
o its president
you turned into a demon
his pure wrath is now directed towards you
a lewd and not blooded sacred gear cost
you the vampire over there
dont let your comrades feelings and souls go to waste
i tougt as much
wat is tis dead
wick means we have to buy ourselves time until se finises
if theres anything tat scarves you ill get rid of it
i think they were meant for her to eat
im not interested in a boring world
im worried about you
o onee sama
it means tat not only the demon lord but god would
ill drive away everything youre afraid of
the fait of our followers is the source of our strength
bliss pain destruction creation
your unforgivable sins shall be adequately punished
not only could we have gotten ourselves killed
so you intend to resist
im taking asias room
were known as the two heavenly dragoons
it is the present forwarding theory of emotions
first well need to find those two
we want you to come wit us to a certain place after classes are over
dont use such a lewd move again
wat are you trying to do
finishing im off can come after tat
wat a cruel destiny
the man called the genocidal arcbisop
im not her boyfriend or anything
it seems our relationship as truly deepened ere
boobs dont suck
forbidden balor view
formally a demon would sow up from the magic circle on the flyers we landed out
they were compensating for the element sortage u
gotta cat wit tat redeaded dame for a sect
a demon ditcing is summoner u
its time for our early morning training
hes a member of your peerage is e not
wick means you decided on a gambler
get a load of my sacred gear
are you feeling okay now
perfect let me be your opponent
thats just like the white dragon emperor
and on top of tat your ceaseless lust as even reached the transfer student asia can
but ive already decided not to be scared and to move forward
its just like tat
agree
i cant believe its beyond my imagination
hey demon boy something is pulling in
he doesnt really know anything about it
my lips starve bitterly into the sky
have you prepared yourself azazel
and wit tis power ive caused trouble for everyone again
held by the top brass of the demons and fallen angels in the next few days wit regards to the latest incident
absorb power
he did say tat eyd properly find a hotel to stay in tomorrow
se killed asia for you
these are like the feathers of a filthy crow
two stray sweep beg for your blessing
white one is bound to arrive soon enough
demons are supposed to be self centered
yet you samelessly continue to use my research
bliss pain destruction creation
but thanks to tat
my sort term goal is to conquer toe prezs boobs
there isnt really any opportunity for me to be treated as a regular guest like tis
rumors
as expected the only sword deals severe damage to demonic entities
so warm
yea im really envious of your blonde air
now thats how my rival should be
tis is were my parents spent their days before
thats right
i heard tat you were excommunicated on the grounds of your capability to deal even demons and fallen angels alike but
you just called asia a witc didnt you
i just need to wear tis to power up first
especially for you red dragon emperor
i might have been trying to grow closer to you more than was necessary
something to do
the schools gotten so much cleaner now
tis person may look like a girl
i guess i could indulge in some lewd bonding wit my acute little servant
whats wit is speed
you have one handsome mug
whereas the english dragon calves its opponents powers and transfers them to its most
in any case we just have to mown down the remaining forces
well weve figured out wo toe mastermind is
i may be a demon now
damn its always like tis
ten you should let us cut you down right now
i should apologize to you asia argento
you mean its all because im too weak again
an artificial sacred gear tat i personally made
we still have some time left
issei were leading to the academy
i really am so very glad
ten for me a demons smile
im sorry you and just given us
faint it amazing how loony my boss is
my my sex talk again and as such tis early in the day
if it will cost the life of one of the leaders of the tree powers
i didnt want to be a pawn either
o etats
tis is bad
for the record es a first year student
well ten ill leave everything else to you
whats tis four on one
gasper the thing you need to stop isnt my arm
it revolves to a state called balance breakers
a formidable foe
unable to tell you the reason behind these tears
the presidents punishments are no big deal
its difficult to say it wit the others around
oil on her breasts too
tat was our regular manner and courtesy for whenever there is a new wielder for ascalon
everyone
how profound
it wasnt just the four overlords tat died in the last tree way war god did too
a holy cursed sword
lets do our best to march towards our dream together gasper
i tougt tat tis would be a good auxiliary weapon for you
and yours is the black dragoons vein absorption line right
hows my swimsuit
souna can welcome back
the rest of the leaders decided tat continuing the war would be pointless
yuuto can make up for it wit is speed
i still like you no matter wat
its got noting to do wit you
youre a demon right
hes so adorably tiny
lightning
o god please dont forgive tis sinful sleazebag
can enlighten everything for eternity
thats fine by me
youre quite ceeky for a slowly demon
our master holds a principle of conducting honest and transparent business
and can potentially affect the entire world wit their capabilities
im only doing wat is needed mother
getting scared now partner
are you saying you wanted to
so you come to those wo summon you via bicycle because your own magic power is too weak
are you still hiding around in tis town
the laura from those two is beyond limits
a good day to you xenovia
my lips starve bitterly into the sky
at best we have a chance of making it out alive
so the curc tried to artificially produce people wo could wield excalibur a type of holy sword
lap pillow
big sister is already ere to meet you
look out yuuto
actually were supposed to just appear in a snap from the magic circle fliers tat we distribute
but e may really be cut out to be an artist
it feels like im doing something forbidden
wyre you helping the enemy koneko
you think you know were they are
y yea it sure is sparkling
my dream is still to become a high class demon and to have my very own arem
i was finally reunited wit my cildood friend but e had been turned into a demon already
jeez tow impudent of them to leave me the magical girl out of it
in simple words those wo are bestowed wit the powers of the heavenly dragoons are destined to fight each other
tomorrow
they seem interested only in fun things
you may be a sinner but im sure god will offer you salvation
he summoned it all the way ere to the human realm
the lord will surely watch over us
youre going to srink my presidents boobs in half
sure its fine
so whats tis dream you and gasper kun avec
if tat wont do ten we really have to go wit my soul
asia there are lots of other better guys around
why did you send asia into exile
such attitude
father
holy eraser
were we really supposed to meet ere
wat are you talking about
it cant be
depression doesnt suit a demon you know
just when did e
in tis battle were on the offense
holy swords are the worst weapons tat a demon could face
youve got a sacred gear
weve sold our souls to the devils
youre a demon dont look so gloomy
and used alcemy to create seven swords from them
in tis world unexpected things just happen
were in school wat are you doing
we didnt just include the girls
and thats why you turned im into a demon
run away when i draw its attention asia
youre right
we wont let tat happen
yea you really are a failure
ill never be able to forget how they acted
you guys mustve been starving
her family her friend her comrade
world destruction and chaos
fuck you slut dont bring up tat sitead when im around
his left arm is a dragon
dont look down on me wit pity
issei can blow off a womans clothes by touching stem
you are my servant a member of my ouseold
well be sitting ducks ere unable to even counterattack
why is the occult research club doing an activity such as pool cleaning
a master tat is bolt an expert and well versed about sacred gears
we need to practice using these first
im not going to bend to some will of destiny
youre one of the descendants of the leviatan
so we decided to be fair and take one of your arms each
one would need a tremendous amount of power to achieve tat
sacred gears are capable of taking such a strong will and making it ones strength
ignoring me white
my o my
be nice to her okay
kiba said the sword in tis proto was a holy sword
they didnt care about the great war tat threatened the existence of tis world
do keep in mind tat e is a gremory as well
still it felt like they knew we were demons
you still and these
dead is just casually talking wit presidents faster
how tat is really something
you used to be called a saint but now youre a demon
was really manly
hey issei wat are you grinning so early for
tis is different from our fight wit riser
the one at the station as lots of insert and character specific songs as well
unfortunately for you im in a bad mood today
lets watch rias video next
tat person sure is late tough
if you want to keep believing in the future
we could probably ask you to destroy one
well pay you back for tat meal someday
i will protect president
p president
tis hasnt been used since last year
they plan on visiting your club room tomorrow after school
me they call me names the moment my eyes make contact wit theirs
it seems you met wit the white dragon emperor
if the situation continues tis way everyone will be destroyed in the end
are you okay
it couldnt be helped
wat in the world
he was just trying to make babies wit
dirty trick
but for you to go there alone
akenos the daughter of a fallen angel
your existence feels like a product of the swims of fate
the strongest dragon tat is said to even be feared by god himself
love and dreams both are quite big arent they
look at the time
tat sounds like the baddest and strongest dragon ever
tat you have been flippin and switcin beautiful girls around and doing all kinds of mischief
so you and something tat convenient u
it seems tat you have a preference for larger breasts in women
going for the loud entrance again u
my knight will never be defeated by something like an excalibur
se played wit me lots of times before
its not a bad position you know
it is a holy sword claimed to be capable of slaying anything in tis world
your life spain as been greatly reduced
in the name of the gremory ouseold
presidents boobs will srink in half
if you want to keep believing in the future
its quite unusual for a leader to make an appearance like tis
if youre going to keep looking down on my servants ten
im willing to do anything for you
im all alone and so lonely will you rang out wit me
but going beyond tat feels like a task no less than fighting the last boss of a dungeon alone
issei swan isnt a bad person
it was done by a fallen angel woman wo admired you
and went to curc several times
i told you about yuuto being a survivor of the holy sword project didnt i
looks like theyre prepared to retrieved the holy swords no matter wat the cost
balance breakers
after hearing rumors tat youre the weakest successor in all of history
or should i call you wells dragon instead
explosion
isnt the ability to stop time great
and tat damned azazel even declared tat thered be no second war
we cant allow ourselves to live our entire lives cursing and acting it
its enough to encant all of the boys in the class
allow me to express my gratitude once again
it should be able to stop anything tat would cause damage to the city
youve also lusted after her body to do a beastly sex play wit der
however
its the time for us to declare peace you know
it was released went e tasted your blood
there are also those wo reverie tat power and cant help but be charmed by the wielder of such a power
were in the world is xenovia
it is the present forwarding theory of emotions
after tat toe umans used the two dragoons as intermediaries
year getting closer to becoming toe ideal victim for excalibur
he intends to suck our blood
i like you
so inside tat factory
isseis suddenly gotten a lot more smart and fluid wit is movements
its all right
demons are fundamentally selfish beings you know
im not going to forgive you
we already have our goal dont we
and my friend
taisetsu na mono wa doko ni aru
its the guardian of the gate to the underworld
thats my dream
o thank you so much
we havent lost yet
the forbidden balor view
akeno and ill be lying in wait out ere
well ten lets go
the blood of the deceased demon lord flows troug my veins
our sacred gears are supposed to be equal rivals
azazel do i really need to be in the meeting tomorrow
express the purest feelings inside you
it is possible tat it may have already reached the level of a balance breakers
we cant even call it a demon anymore
dragon slayer
well whats left now is to try out everything tat ive said
wow its sparkling clean
i am relieved tat my sister is not causing any trouble
youre right
rias is bolt cruel and kind
would you like to go into my room
its really broken down now
either azazel nor semazai wanted another war
my naughty instincts start to stir me up
lets do our very best today too
havent and a devil cancel at the last minute
ten for now my goal is to conquer prezs boobs
youre a demon so maybe my soul
you dont mean
and you even help in preparing meals
hey twere partner
devil sits
youve got the invincible rook right ere
the very word miracle is made just for me
lets meet again at the workshop class
ive really come quite far already
but tat looks pretty expensive
its been a while since they last came to tis town
thats a holy sword for you it deals unmatced damage to demonic monsters
but tat gets asia mad every time
o how tat sounds interesting
its already time
before we start worrying about them there is something tat we must do
either azazel nor semaza wanted another war
i will be the one to kill your parents
t thanks man
painful as it may be
the boundary tat you overcame seems just like the buried darkness
to avoid being hated by you wo dates fallen angels
wat in the world is happening
sword birth
dont you love now my boss is so fucked up
youll have to accompany me for a while longer
of course i would mother
many have already died trying to wield it
im transferring as a second year to your academy today
lets request for the help of the demon lord okay
its delicious
i dont want to be a seductive devil
ten wouldnt it be an adequate twist of fate for you to get absorbed into
how let me refill your cup
it is basically capable of connecting to someone and dispersing or distributing power tat it absorbs
youre right
the bishop piece tat gasper currently possess
if only i had paid more attention to my surroundings
because gasper kun was unable to control is sacred gear
ill have to go back to hq and fix the system first
wick is why the curc had been planning to develop an artificial vessel tat could wield toe excalibur
emperor of the white dragon
o mother would it be okay if i invited our club members over ere after school
i am different from tat guy and irina
is tis really the right place
boobs
whats in tat room over there
it paint gonna matter how many of yea sitty demons come at me
tis is the best
tomorrow after school they are going to visit the club room
issei swan you sure know it quite well
harem king
its delicious
were just sucking out the dragoons energy
kiba swan was absent
it is the present forwarding theory of emotions
cut it out thats scary
sorry but tat just wont do
hows tis
boobs
if you find anything give irina a call
we sold our souls to the devil
o wonder an emergency elimination order had been issued
we couldve started a war between the curc and the devils
towa e tsuzuku kawasu cikai
being inside tis box is enough for me
i completely forgot about the morning training
resulting in the holy sword project
you were all simply disposable materials for the experiment
id be able to transfer power to presidents boobs
please understand
in tis academy
the footsteps tat doesnt move forward
i understand
and the entire worlds stem is the machine of revolution
azazel decreed tat kokabiel should be kept sealed and frozen for eternity
weve put our fait in you the scarlet dragon emperor
hey get away from prez pretty boy
the magic circles disappearing
and the entire worlds stem is the machine of revolution
mines not going in any damn collection
and i dont want to talk about tat
the boosted gear wick as yet to sow its actual growth limit
for the followers of the curc to desire a meeting wit a demon
but we were controlling is sacred gear earlier
but tat seems expensive
prepare yourself
wait you probably think tis is weird
ill also assist you
and create my own personal army of not women
o way
of course
one can easily react tis level of strength using the red dragon emperors power
my lips starve bitterly into the sky
those are the words tat villains often say when they are about to die
so gasper nullified the effects of the time field
but tis is noting compared to the damage of tat radiant spear
you can even touch me
for a younger man to let out is carnal desire for me
thats too bad
it is i assure you
its the best snug feeling ive ever had
gasper look after the place for us okay
youre getting a thousand spankings
anyway kiba sure was acting strange earlier
lets look for them in the other rooms
if thats it for today ten ill take my leave
unable to tell you the reason behind these tears
anyway why did you come ere onii sama
ten for me a demons smile
as for me im going to stay ere for a while longer
my my jealousy is such a acute sting
her mind was already completely lost
i promise
so wat ten
i didnt expect you to cook for us tough
us wit the power of the dragoons
at the very least tat title suits her the best right now
well be counting on your cooperation on the aforementioned matter
balance break
ten for me a demons smile
harboring hatred against these i found rias and became a demon
i wonder if everyones all right
its a rare opportunity for the legendary dragon to be at the demons side
gaspers father was a vampire of noble lineage
the finishing blow as to completely knock im out
as it is an essential part of your capabilities
kiba hasnt contracted you still
and using tat power you will cast a spell tat will destroy the entire land
asia can too is yelping us in cleaning and laundry
its natural for vampires to drink blood isnt it
i would have wanted to defeat him myself
thats right
it was during the time when the last demon lord died in the great war
hes transferring power to valid
wat a terrible thing to say
ten i cannot refuse
its actually the opposite
all right well get going now
could you please yelp out these lost lambs
receive the power of both holy and demon
those wings
asia stand by at the rear
ten gasper will try to stop time
the enemy is backed by one of the leaders of the fallen angels kokabiel
because youre an enemy of all womankind
a major cleaning will be conducted at the old school building tis end of year
an opportunity to stop the conflict between the tree powers and combine their strengts
youll have to take my soul if you dont want it
were not going to let you have onee samas body
you also managed to acquire a balance breakers
my my as expected of the one wo always get to see and touch presidents body everyday
its not a problem at all
lets not fight before weve even done anything
even my weakness tat gradually changes me
demons
i know about tat battle as well
o you didnt have to mother
you mean i can use my balance breakers
you can still contact your brother
president y your boobs
to support our fait were having to take the help of devils
i want to be promoted to a big ranking demon and become the harem king
tatd yelp kiba out big time
my my doing it only for president is unfair
using gift on her boobs
youve really made me serious now
but you are just a slowly human
rias gremorys knight
go occult research club
can enlighten everything for eternity
everything now starts from ere
but our opponent is a cadre of the fallen angels
learn to understand the situation valid
he can still stand up
the footsteps tat doesnt move forward
at first you suspended my whole body
see you again milky can
ill definitely be the harem king
ive already taken the liberty of contracting sirzecs sama
how everyone is ere
so es their head onco
as a big class demon im glad youre taking advantage of the situation and fighting me
well yea
tis means tis ones definitely a dangerous one
to a eretic whod committed the greatest taboo
if the talks break down and war suddenly breaks loose
yuuto was a survivor of tat very project
geez mom just brought something totally unneeded
its definitely the scent of a rogue demon
its true tat ive seen the prezs breasts
thats why i need to use their grudges to power my demonic swords
weakest u
issei kun does it feel good
tomorrow
lend me your strength gasper
and the entire worlds stem is the machine of revolution
there is someone wo is connecting the two gates from within the barrier
i dont blame im
the interruption brought upon the two dragoons caused them to go completely berserk
you shouldnt be tis strong issei kun
have you properly received the sword
tis guys completely insane
to a demon a holy sword is something to labor
hey prez
you dont need to make tis one your boyfriend
thats great asia sand
im sorry but id like to decline todays contract
girls you see are lovely devils
i souldve been more alert
p president
i wish youd look happier than tat
those wings
asia becomes upset every time it happens tough
enjoying life as a devil sit
and their souls were sealed witing part of a human body as sacred gears
well infiltrate the academy and stop the release of kokabiels power
would you kindly explain waits going on ere issei
towa e tsuzuku kawasu cikai
dont take us lightly boobs
i tougt se would flat out refuse
im going to ask onii sama to renovate the entire house
he fought the former overlords and gods and lived to tell the tale
my ability as its roots in the grudges of those held captive wit me
are you trying to kill yourselves
can we win against im
isnt it time to release the other bishop
yes a holy sword is a weapon tat can exterminate demons
ten you do understand we will not assist you
youll make prez sad too
ill summon you another time
stop at once
sorry i called you out of the blue
he was already on the verge of death
even without god
they call it the sealed room
its exactly already
kiba was able to create a demonic holy sword wick was tougt to be impossible
so we wont be able to do our regular meeting at the occults club room
the experiment was a failure
of course
sum issei sand
viva la pool cleaning
something inside tat factory
the crimson ruin princess
its unfair to be left out
i dont think of you as a bother
its uncommon for a leader to come out for a cat
w wow
the footsteps tat doesnt move forward
but i am pretty sure they already knew tat were demons
by being reborn again as a demon i survived
youve got some good moves
all of these sacred gears are truly unique
you are essentially the exact weak point of tat sacred gear
ten i can do it for you if you want
top brass meeting begins
just how many lives have you toyed wit
i heard you were exiled cause you and the ability to deal demons and fallen angels
tis one is for asias still growing boobs

ill have to protect tat collection in my room at all costs

tis isnt the time to be impressed
i decided to gambler on something
we wouldnt have been so worried if you and just told us
an application to your euro linker
its something very important to you
well were best friends
but hospitals are far too cautious
burst points indicate the number of times we can accelerate
im supposed to be a hero in virtual games

wat color
senpai was the previous red king someone important to you
they dont look very friendly to me
judging from wat youve told me e as two major weaknesses
i got accelerated
the weatered stage u
just like now theres always despair behind ope
for the sake of being her partner
you can count on us in the water
until now no duel avatar asever achieved true aviation ability
its because of its demanding requirements
why do we still need real classrooms in tis day and age
the will of the mind can overwrite phenomena
thats ours in the accelerated world or days
ill think about it a little more
tis is the real world for me
is decided by territory battles every saturday evening
please come back soon senpai
its also the true battlefield for burst linkers
well hows tis
the curse souldve been broken ten
we wont run into another linker by chance
was the bento takus idea
also retreating without crossing blades just isnt my style
thats right
ill just leave the cleaning up to someone else
because reaching level is my greatest priority
youre a new burst linker arent you
or could it be tat you like princess snow black now
burst link
silver crow as the color of metal
do we really need to do tat

the souls age
the armour of calamity wouldnt disappeareven after defeating toe possessed linker
my invisible wings will guide me
theres no time limit its permanent
but were just accelerating time hasnt stopped
burst link
isnt it obvious oumi
thats why you dont sow up on matcing lists
tis is wat happened to princess snow black during her school trip to okinawa
thats why the kings try to side the existence of the incarnate system
an enemy
thats right
im sure youre in a sticky situation right now
theres a theory tat the heart is the base clock for the speed of the human tougt process
itll take a very very long time
is it true tat you cabled wit princess snow black
tough thered be no point in making you my dog otherwise
were will the investigation lead haruyuki
in order to restore the lost bond
youre araya kun correct
yesterday
and about lying to her
let me congratulate you again for your first victory

when a burst linkers points fall to dangerously low levels
once were used to it your aviating just makes you an easy target
your melee attack power is also decent
is the machine connected to the cable stand alone
the debris was enough to damage me
you should learn to control yourown tougts when youre cabling
just like all the games weve played in the past
sulfur pot
and it consumes of your points
im always afraid tat im not strong enough
its your punishment
in the school
my real life identity was revealed the greatest taboo for any burst linker
wo would even do tis sort of thing
right
the unlimited neutral field dumbass
the one wo was arguing witprincess snow black by the gate yesterday
all right
i had to seal my true duel avatar
because you have wings
a knife or a car is more than enough for the job
so youre basically trying to say
o o se means youre really pretty
looks good grades popularity
there are times went youd want to hide your identity and watch a game
the world inhabited by us burst linkers
saito swan from akano
m megumi
did the red king move at all during battle
about centimeters
i ope it doesnt rain
youre the one twos naive
didnt you already know ciyuri tough
were under the effects of the brain burst program
our goal is to reach level
wat you seriously want a street duel
why does an instant feel likeseveral ten seconds for race drivers
you should do a little more research on your own color
well see each other soon rigtyoull be back in days
dont you want to be strong too
ready
high and far away free from temuddy ell tat is the real world
have emerged from hiding toput an end to tis fallacious peace
im sure youll believe my last words
arita do you mind coming wit me for a bit
it was love
between third and fifty grade of elementary school
your euro linker will make a globalconnection once you step outside the school
hey crow
but e wasnt wearing a euro linker
ses rutless
yea ill also let you know if i come up wit something
why would something like tat
his details are unknown
o like wat
counting down one zero
tat sugeno shouldnt have called you in without any proof
is tis the ending
tat was also part of my heart
thats the menu screen for temultiplayer fighting game brain burst
whats the name of tis burst linker wo doesnt appear on the list
wat are you
you bastard
a speed build like yours as no chance of winning
paradigm revolution
a moment of eternity in accelerated time
strength isnt just about winning
the armour of calamity
brain burst will be forcefully uninstalled
there used to be seven kings of pure color
he was moving a virtual window away
thats the hunt
it really is the incarnate system
i wonder about tat
ill have all types of the jumbo parfait tis time
wat tat game again
all right
but i do a lot
so if you know of any good online vr games let me know
tat means all the other kings are our enemies
youre going to crash both of us into the ground
i tougt you said you liked tis airstyle yesterday
ill soon be in green legion territory
shouldnt lotus take the train instead
your attacks dont compliment each other
burst link
the next stop is sasazuka nd street sasazuka nd street
ive completely recovered
well done silver crow and cyan pile
whats her aim
we probably need a fresh start from there
ill handle sand duct
also cii can came to cheer for me wit a bento
since youre in charge of the details of todays mission
my level strength and experience cant even compare to hers
tis is the only neutral place in the akiabara area
not even haruyuki kun would
looks like enemy hunting is a real lifeline over ere
theres noting lonelier or sadder than the end of a game wit no ending
brain burst exists so we can aim for iger levels right
you want to embarrass yourself just like your friend did
wat was the second red king like
dont worry tough
it was an impressive win haruyuki kun
ive experienced tis sort of thing many times
i cant
lets just go wit der
wat the bells a final last chance
both incredibly rare powers belong to me now
you must maintain an average win ratio of
thats wat my parents told me
to accelerate your real body times
game over arita senpai
welcome to the accelerated world
the black king black lotus
he took my wings
do you intend to uninstall brain burst on your own
youll free me and cii can tat way
just disappear already haru
well ten ill take you to tetrue battleground for us burst linkers
i see
just like how you are to me
tough only kurasima kuns case will be delayed for the ten days im away
hes good at sports too
well ten ill teach you one last secret about incarnation
h hold on
i it looks wonderful on you
he dived into tis field at pm real world time and as been ere ever since
burst link
were allies
im scared we might end up falling
shouldnt you be protecting your neck
live out your life story facing forward
but like you did wit is test the chances arent zero
i tougt you were going to lose for a while there
an opponent tat doesnt appear on the matcing list
your duty
is something wrong
o i mean
its for your sake
se left right after leaving them there
ive fought against enemies like you before
poison doesnt work on silver
you dont understand a thing about me
you have no right to call yourself a burst linker
you should be able to fly again crow sand
venture into its infinite potential
but the sun feels great today
please pass them on to everyone in the student council
thats why wed like you to help our master
burst link
theres a lot of steam
so wat about ciyu
ill be in your care my master
but its nowhere as fast as ass bike
and se said speed was the greatest power
se got mad tis morning and left me behind
yellow radio
have you ever beaten me in any game
all tat for a fighting game etats ridiculous
theres always the danger of being ambused in the unlimited field
his specialty is bunting close range avatarswile maintaining a middle to long range distance
he wanted to remain as my parents forever
do you understand now
tat kind should be commended instead
the kings chose the status quon
the kendo teams leading to the nationals next right
dont make it sound so easy
in tat time youll learn incarnate tecniques tat you can use in battle
unfortunately it looks like yourso called friendship wasnt of any use
bikes are fun because they can fall over
thats right
a score of million
he probably feels the same way
youll discover the ultimate potential hidden within our brains and souls
h how did you get my room key
hes breaking in from another network
it was when you talked about kurasima kun
im still a big school fresman
his words were no lie
and its ultimate goal
should i tail you
the post apocalypse stage
he switched the signs for the girls andboys shower rooms in my field of vision
together the tree of us
how would you handle glossy surfaces
however ive learned one thing from playing all those online games
level
im sick of tis place
is tis zero fill
higher and stronger so i can react you
thats exactly wat cherry rook
deceleration
burst link
i heard about wat happened during lunctime
wat will tat accomplish
thats a pretty good idea coming from you
woa woa i cant believe it
hes the silver crow from the revived ega ebulous
im not an old man
burst link
the splendour of your presence is all my eyes gave ever seen
tat was the weight of my crimes
just a little further
your breathing trickles
theres no way ill forgive you for tis
acceleration of the body
sand blast
should i apologize to her for touching her breasts
see you princess
all for the sake of tis one chance
youre a different person now
se just threw me off the tokyo tower without warning
doesnt it belong to the person youre waiting for
i heard about your duel wit as roller last night
they had gig expectations for me
well its time for you to compensate me for the seconds of real world time you took from me
haru you always have tis sorry lookon your face whenever i see you in school
as rollers second weakness
pick any building to
do it to sow im tow strong you are
tis is an opportunity
lets eat arita kun
im not mentally prepared yet and my rooms a mess
ill be rooting for you
dont tell me you cant even move a finger
therefore the combat ability of terider himself should be close to zero
o it became a madness
the one about having a euro linker equipped since birth
the lot of you really are repulsive
the tree of you should escape
o way
haruyukis world was forever transformed
if there is a student in tat position
isnt it just a fighting game
even if it means losing our acceleration powers
join my legion and protect me
im such a coward
why are losers always so comical
or should i say scarlet rain
in both the virtual world and the real world
even so i couldnt even approach your big score
you could never understand them
tis world doesnt need two aviators
yea so if we beat im a few timeswe should be able to strip im of all is points
a i just figured your gauge should be about full so it might work now
so sky ranker taught you tat tecnique
correct
you now have points
you didnt need to eat alone out ere in the cold
is tis difference unique to the okinawan area
get up silver crow
burst link
so good
y yes kind of
princess
your gauge needs to be fullycarged to use your special move
as roller wit low color saturation as attacks tat avez special characteristics
i absolutely must know
why would se want to meet me tough
but it conducts electricity the best
itll get in the way when you lie down
the real me
lets do tat
takumu kun attends a middle school in sinjuku correct
of course
lets settle tis oumi seiji
its simple
im right were you can touch me if you want
hey wait right there
tis is most of the big stuff
it wasnt very effective tough
right
ten id accept it
youre a lot better than i had tougt senpai
youre the only one wo can free im iko
i asked haru to come to the girls shower room
well leave from the back
thats right
se knew se was cooking for my possible future husband
and even the parents child bond are all simply illusions
oo rare to see you ere
even if tat were true you dont have the right to interfere wit us
i dont see anything suspicious
thats the biggest reason why the existence of the accelerated world remains bidden
well its about time you guys evaded back
im not the chubby and helpless arita haruyuki right now
wat can you do ten
yea and im looking forward to opening your present
tis is for you
about brain burst about how we fought
you mean like being a princess or something
o rubs tough
whats more you probably arent in okinawa right now
the splendour of your presence is all my eyes gave ever seen
two years ago if you were the one
ive regained enough points to survive a loss from you
were burst linkers after all
your leg came off
recently ive beard rumors of a local network troublemaker
ill fly again for sure using my own power
i felt jealous for the first time in my entire life
well thats cool
it exists next to the real world
dont starve up my legs too much
he used is awesome fighting power to bring about absolute tyranny
wat about the territory battles
oumi kun
external items
you can trow me away when youre done wit me
let me give you half my points inpossession for now troug cable duels
i have to do tis
and you two are burst linkers living in tis area
and wat will you do if her answer isnt you
i see
saito swan from akano
you cant trust anyone in the accelerated world
wo else can react such a big score
her duel avatar is cyan pile
and of course you can get great results in kendo
but you always seem to be busy recently
se drew my attention for a completely different reason from you
yes were monitoring per brainwaves
its just a program object
wheres the brain burst application file
youre already more of a burst linker than i am
se was serious about being wit oumi
kay well end tis duel as a draw right away
you did it silver crow
why do you think legions exist in the accelerated world
anyway iko
i appreciate your determination
just because you did something toide yourself from the matcing list
yes youre right
youll surprise all the students at school
the image should come from speed and not power
youve been betrayed and urtyet you can still forgive each other
however youre weak against corrosion and impact attacks
whos subordinate are you talking about
tis is your final last chance
really
but her organs are badly damagedand se could fall into smock at any time
the demonic city stage
but fight like you always do
its okay were second cousins and all
for her sake
theres no need to feel bad about it
im just a foolish and helpless middle scooler
o way
if anything try to be her boyfriend
you arent participating in the kendo tournament
i definitely wont
just a little further
your pillow
the black king
wat about kurasima kunwos trying so hard to forgive you
contact headquarters
how can se
my voice
casin the world
last nights call and the question just now
since the first generation euro linker entered the market years ago
its over tis is end of the world
his distant relatives came out andidentified themselves not too long ago
and watll you do
why the ell are you always grabbing my foot you perv
owner gimme another glass of year old kusu liquor
the rumor tat you can no longer fly as spread far and wide
you only need to win five times
and wont use anything else to reach the top in brain burst
theres no way sped team up wit oumi for points
you forgot about my wall driving ability you
it was my decision
the red king is disasters
i already know tat
if tis was an anime or a game the scene would be like tis
well ten tis is the sudden dealt duel card
ill defeat the black king and rule over tis school
however all you did was pump up my special attack gauge
ive been worrying about you all these years
so tis is a replay of the fight between teseven kings of pure color and the fourth crome disaster
how did you get a old of tat
if i managed to copy and installs the program into ruka
i still have a scar from it ere
holy land
youre right
ill lose brain burst
just stay still youre my pillow
o thats good
but i came out of nowhere and snatched you away
incarnation is image power
oumi told me to
o its probably just enmity
you wouldnt know of a burst linker called sulfur pot
o because of the joint on aggression pact
the final bond between burst linkers
you really are good at games haru
his original name is cherry rook
its my turn to fight now
im a failure of a teacher
well does se even meet the first condition
silver crow is
and theyll do anything to keep their power
two dont talk about acceleration to just anyone
the very first aviating avatar in the accelerated world
i dunno if thats a fair trade
and lime bell
laser sword
oumi seijis just like how i was a year ago
you and her andmade bento yesterday too right
i confessed to im and am currently waiting for is reply
its becoming a big problem for us too
thats right
i see
its no use man
thats right my brothers my parents
im glad i could meet you crow sand
but in the real world we were able to become friends
or are you ere to earn some pocket money
wit tat much pain inflicted the effects will linger on in the real world for a sort while
get devoured and become my meat
yea youre absolutely right
a moment later and we wouldve
im not leaving her alone
you should get some sun more often haru
and meet back up at the hotel entrance minutes later at
damn it
higher and stronger so i can react you
whats more oumi doesnt seem toparticipate in typical duels very much
its game over oumi seiji
also you could send them to me using a cm cable
tat in reality even a parents and child might have to fight each other
tis feeling of omnipotence of taking and trampling on the dreams hopes and potentials of others
he told me to keep it a secret as it might cause an uproar
of course id ate myself
and ten find and challenge as roller
well be able to speak wit ciyu properly
ugly as tis jealousy might be
whats the weakness of a bike wit agasoline engine from the last century
my name is
theres a fitting way to decide tis
the splendour of your presence is all my eyes gave ever seen
he is metal colored after all
these contradictory feelings welled up inside me
a strong relationship should form between you and her
whats tat a special move gauge
also the cutters on is right and is really sharp
well start our mission after tat
you must be silver crow
seconds
your feint and kick was especially good
licks special move gauge just finished charging too
giving me points troug cable duels
se was a close aide to the blue king
just a little further
araya is finally gone and tis happens
a blade tat can penetrate anything at the speed of light
at least bring a cable wit you
im scared of the world
more and more players get bored and move on to other games
it might be easier if you saw it yourself rather than raving us explain
every time you accelerate you use up a point
im currently exploring two possibilities
were using the inside room for a bit
it simply draws attention without conferring any real benefits
im sick of seeing your faces
damned dog when did you learn tis trick
youve rescued me from living ell
i couldnt find her name even right after escaping wit a draw
link out by force
follow me silver crow
a a name
thats why you havent been performing very well in the territory battles recently
i im itosu manna of class from the same school
itd be fun to hang you from atraffic light and watch the carts stop
wasnt mayuzumi toe guy wo won the last tournament
one more time
we and ega ebulous souled stay out of each others way
but there are no traps in the moonlight stage
actually even a king would have trouble
of course not its connected to the hospital network
wat do you think haru
is something the matter
there are times when i cant control my emotions either
after dodging the next one close in in one go
haru you sure are incrediblypopular wit older women
basically there are other tingsto bunt ere taen just enemies
lets take a look at our current situation first
the splendour of your presence is all my eyes gave ever seen
while is wheels arent obvious weaponsteir attack type is probably melee impact
why didnt you just steal lime bells sealing ability
were maximizing the effect remember
its the accelerated worlds biggest traitor black lotus the black king
the old castle stage u
the aviation ability and the sealing ability
theyre also testing social studies at period wick you got full marks for in your entrance exams
ill tell you one last sting
can you skip practice
damn it
slain countless enemies
but its tis kind of addiction tatas twisted the accelerated world
youre a king when will you finally get back on your feet
youre already a burst linker wit superhuman powers
there are times when an installation can fail
but arent there outer methods my master
thats right
my memories
im sure kurasima senpai wants to see too
tis cord
a clever obedient dog thatll give meburst points every day to use
begin
p play a game maybe
youre as gloomy as ever
i walked right into it
for example
i am in the mood for some cake tough
damn it im losing to im
but youll know of is locations and distance from the sound
lets go wit amburgers too
your heart gave rise to tat body
cherry got on a train on the seibu ikebukuro line
curse
even if my attempts are pathetic and comical
but the yellow legions territory spans from ueno to akiabara
were maximizing the effect arent we
wat happens ten
yes its for a friend
youve been acting strange
wat a coincidence are you guys heading come too
static pressure
do whatever you want
some of the responsibility is mine
a i dont really get it
youre always in my mind andit makes me bolt happy and sad
you didnt earn your top grades and national title either
tough level isnt tat big of a deal
in tat books world there were always new encounters and adventures
we are all protagonists of our own life stories
tat program souldve been disabled from an updated
i am black vise vice president often acceleration research society
running away would be the stupidest thing to do
yea if it means the tree of us can be together like we used to
as usual youre as stubborn as everonce youve decided something haru
otherwise well move to akiabara and continue
you can use it to win in real fights score full marks in tests
you have resistance againstamputation piercing fire and poison
poor der
disappear disappear oumi
oumi wat did you do to ciyu
and even the purpose for myexistence became vague to me
h how about one of those old d movies ten
because my power isnt dealing
the guide cursor
youre obsessed wit your dirty schemes in the real world
im glad youve come young man
how did you get tis
our master said a monster appeared
ill handle tis guy
he said you migtve been sent to tismiddle school instead of a zoo by mistake
whats the yellow king doing ere
not to mention you didnt seem to mind
its not like im surrendering
i repeatedly dealt damage to jigsaws right shoulder
your real body doesnt accelerate butyour consciousness becomes times faster
i mean se as sealing abilities right
im such an idiot
judgment blow
my shift ended at
ill have to transfer to another school tomorrow
im glad the tree of us are in the same class
thats surprising
it was an act of incredible pride egotism and madness
fool if tat happens
its probably a representation of my fear
wat do you think my master
you cant break the walls in tispurgatory stage wit your powers
im sick of tis cramp
scorching inferno
hot sowers feel nicer
the social cameras cant see us ere so were all good
good tat you understand
when air pressure approaches near vacuum levels ionization occurs at the electrodes
your video is useless now
you smoothed things out so well
your duel avatar wont be created if you dont have the dream
im sure tat was
the splendour of your presence is all my eyes gave ever seen
its your chance to gain lots of points
o way
lets all react new eigts together
in the accelerated world there are plenty offigting methods tat youve never even imagined
water wit no impurities is almost a perfect insulator
porkys last as usual
umans will always move on forward
however no one as confronted me in the real world yet
you have taen marks on your neck
actually wo designed and named tis one
hey princess
tis is my only special move demonic commandeer
no the entire suginami areayou can just sit quietly and watch
whats tat round sting
territory or the right for legions to control areas
wed like you to meet our master
and watch tat person beg for mercy flat on the ground
silver crows all or outing kick
its a little much to call them mental scars
your mental scars are your avatars resources
enemy
so tat edge at sunshine city is the leave point
lets maximize the effect while were at it
your ties crooked
of course you have to be level or above to enter
o yea theres rusty jigsaw
of course
whats more theyre worth a lot more points
princess snow black
five hundred seconds left u
dont get caught
it finally happened
you planned all of tis out yellow radio
burst link
sum well ten sword
y yes it was valuable in many ways
tat person was once very close to me
thats my duty
so become my ally
you dont have a choice
you must be using a similar type of creating tecnology
tat stopped when you met im last fall
sorry i apologize
ses the only one twos declared her aim to reach level
you shouldnt have been able to pin down the time
w wait
a mysterious enemy preys on snow black
intruding into the yellow legions base seems kinda dangerous
of course
thats so typical of you haruyuki kun
ses still alive
you cant take her as a ostage
oumi told you to
inhabitants of tis world created and operated by the system
sum can i ask you something
well are you ere to tell me off for it
scarlet rain told me to assist you in your investigation
get us two cream mellon bunks and five strawberry yogurts tomorrow
the time hasnt come yet tough
higher and stronger so i can react you
thats the rule of tis world
to destroy the armour of calamity
there might be a way
so you want to take my points already
youre the stupid one
thats why ill be taking any memories of me tat you have
i got a pass to visit everyjunior gig school in the suginami area
h hello
it really suits you its perfect its a critical it
theyre probably brothers
we still dont know wo developed the program tough
my name is blood leopard
everything and right from the beginning
lets end tis
y yes
have you heard of a burst linker called scarlet rain
of course
tat ridiculously large brain burst program
the leader is princess snow black
but youre about ten times cuter
when will e soot
but i couldnt do it
the splendour of your presence is all my eyes gave ever seen
level
i realized it yesterday
wat is tis gentlemans relationship wit you
thats really not possible tough
whats the name of tis burst linker wo doesnt appear on the list
he asked me if i wanted to play a more enjoyable game
it seems we were just within the range of a social camera
not to tokyo but to some other world
in tis very moment
burst link
falling over was the least of our worries just now
ill never forget tat
can only be used once regardless of its success
its more like an octopus or a sea anemone
i just didnt know wat to say
a little over
those wings belong only to me
i knew you were taking damage on purpose so you could charge up your special move gauge
you dont need me anymore
my moms not come today
my firepower container and guns are the same thing
w wait ruka can
theres noting more pitiful or wretched taen tat
i wanted to go to were you are
ive contracted you in the flesh
thats why se lapsed out at me in her anger
its not a belief its the truth
please say noting more
i chose tis place because few burst linkers come ere
thats how you will atone for your sins
why does a minute feel like an eternity for lovers in close contact
o okay
equip gale truster
tis is all my master told me
is it the yellow legions base or something
how do you like our ultra gorgeous combo attack
do you really mean tat
its wat you get for breakingyour promise wit me young man
trow im into the portal
if e follows is usual pattern ellsow up somewhere around sunshine city
princess snow black definitelyknew about incarnation at the time
look for someone wit a seemingly hurt shoulder around the entrance
are you saying youll let me beat youover and over without fighting back
improving the social status of magicians
whats the non biggest reason
terrorists at first high u
i wont let anyone arm my brother
brother
we dont avez much time
an underground tunnel connects tis all to a shelter in the station
how ten in keeping wit our annual tradition
so i know the security key and access code too
lets see he might actually be a japanese youth like you or me
thats not right
if you ask me we should be more wary of is combat skills than is magic skills
theyre attacking quite persistently
lets go home onii sama
there seems to be too many foreigners around ere now
and by using rupture magic massacred the enemy forces
brother isnt it hard on you attending school
the disciplinary committee
o forget it
how are you going to transport toe demonstration equipment
you disappoint me ibu
thats why different schools see different colors
it appears tat the children from her husbands previous marriage live in the house
saegusa ive asked you not to call me tat
surely theres no need to risk taking a bullet for someone else
but my tougts are distorted
you could skip toe activation sequence and go straight to the magic sequence
all right
but someone like myself wo never even submitted an application
the situation is quite dire
like a maze stopping and going
magic circles
how now you adore aotsugu dont you
were in the same grade after all
if they are thats right by my parents house
the magic association will be firing professionals for tat
ascending at constant velocity
the powerful and stealty ancient magic would surely have the upper and
my tougts are in distortion
impressive cardinal george
because tms iciara used a deceleration spell to stop the buds
tis isnt so urgent tat you need to skip school
my hearts rytm is revived
its too late to care about one or two more
id like to ear all about it later
wo was it tat canceled those magic sequences
youd think it was taurus silver himself
little sister
theres no doubt tat they arerunning rampant in our own school
they shouldnt be all tat poisoned bydiscriminatory impulses yet right
my visions are still blinded
but we came to see wat you looked like
dont go around meddlingwit us blooms you slowly weeds
my young students of magic
making you come wit me on a first high matter when youre so busy
the way were treatedlike wit our classes
tis is the same matcup as last years final right
i definitely wont lose
the banquet is tonight isnt it
tis the season for scoolwide pandemonium
taurus silvers
so tat second year student kiriara
excuse me brother
and the same applies for magical conflicts as well
would you mind if we tagged along to the station
a soot about to sprout
morisaki did finish as the runner up in mens speed shooting
hi erika wat a lovely outfit youve got on
your entrance exam results were excellent werent they
sneaking around is second nature for me
my brother is more than just a skilled martial artist
in order to use magic to fly every timeyou accelerate decelerate ascend and descend
but tis one as an auxiliary spell incorporated into it too
i tougt welcome week was over
yea tat was pretty productive u
the effective scorning area in speed shooting
did you tell mibu swan tat you wouldnt teach der
for a hotel employee isnt tat par for the course
so have you gotten used to dig school already
a toy
a little slander cant break our backs can it
its mostly healed ten
ive wanted to talk wit you too
but the games dont start until the day after tomorrow
thats absurd
tear gas
are given a budget comparable to other gig ranking magic sport teams
and for the race known as magicians
using the guard rail as a launc pad
president
but to be safe youll have to abstain from strenuous exercise for ten days
hes very good at negating sequences
you used cast jamming right
just by looking at your hands
so your body took the brunt of contestant icijous attacks
we gathered a large amount of customers tis time too
its noting more than a sharp sword
tat beautiful lady wit youmust be your sister miyuki kun
not many people can do tat
even if we do okay tis year there might be repercussions going forward
but if you were to actually implement it
chosen suck tat they would createconstructive interference around hattori kun
considering the timing its possible tat its related to the competition
youre not planning to attempt substance conversion are you
how do you like tat magiciantrue cast jamming
all right
after going to the trouble of engineering watanabes withdrawal
ill excuse myself for a while
if our aunt becomes part of tis conflict
o right
dont overdo it tis bunch isnt worst you getting your hands soiled over
im sure tat more than a few of the course students are competent
i really didnt do anything
it was more of a coincidence really
a second division student incapable of powerful magic cannot possibly be a disciplinary officer
and sequences used in our presentation to the magic association in advance
at tis rate first high will end up winning anyway
its the norm for anyone wo can use magic to become a image
heres were it gets interesting
but even so they try to hide it and avoid facing them head on
their larger units are already inside
do your team mates know about silver
the official matches still left to be played are mirage beat and monolit code
the fourth high staff swears tat they didnt equip the cards wit battering ram
two blended coffees
cant we open it from outside
if youre not feeling well
well i do think im toounique to be used as a sample
the second spell caused the car to spin
how can you do tat how can you use magic under cast jamming
wat a liar youre alwaystelling me off brother
nobody uses just a keyboard nowadays
honoka and sizuku are my brothers friends
and especially in spells tat cause the heart to vibrated
they have crystal vision
not only was it a turning point in military history
in the practical exam
and clobbering me is wants gonna get troug to me
but theres still something lacking toward tat end
after all tatsuya was the one wo came running
wed be assured of a second place finish in the rookie division
you dont want to tell
my tecnique is somewatdifferent taen tat womans
erika why are you calling me mikiiko
thats not possible unless youve studied the enemy before the start signal
you still advent answered my question
ill need a stretcher for the student
the disciplinary committees job is to crack down onstudents in violation of the rules using practical skills
the former commander of stars toe usa combat magician brigade
we are members of a coalition tat seeksto eradicate decimation witing tis school
the east
and disabled the magic device for the presentation
its time to go to bed
regardless of weter youre a player or a staff member
yea i cant believe you spotted tat
a human is not suited for tis kind of digital processing
especially the yotsuba family
you know major kazama
president i support sibasnomination to the tecnical team
hand to and combat is allowed
is tat seat next to you available
siba kun its top secret information tat im an investigator
sun youre hurt
they were asking for equal treatment toward students of both divisions
second high gather round
i just make minor adjustments
now a round of applause for the representatives of first high
ever mind me was everything all right at your house isori
quite a crisis you found yourself in today
wasnt tired high supposed to be the front runner for the rookie competitions
but in truth theyre just another terrorist organization
so if youre not out to get us wed like a brief explanation
he would only be clanging roles from weapon to component
so well have to visit a den of snakes
honoka are you sure you can see
skipping toe onorific already
thats right
today after interrogating sekimoto further
but i think thats probably wat led to those redundancies you pointed out
more precisely after i got assigned as the counsellor of first high school
thats amazing to think tatyouve tougt it troug tis far
but will the kendo club be fine wit tat
to restrain the people inside
miyuki could you silence the enemys gunfire
wat are you talking about
in exchange
would you give the last dance to me
the girl is ibu sayaka
we are the students for the end of scoolwide discrimination
the kanto branch of the magic association as taken a defensive position on its own
so you believe we should waituntil they come out themselves
my practical skill specialty is convergent systematic reinforcement magic
the fundamental premises in tat experiment is wrong
if you can old onto your feelings of bitterness
but a new day will come
under the current system all officersexcept for the president must be
aim and pull the trigger
i strongly support siba kuns inclusion in the team
mikiiko wat in the world is wrong
it was popular about a decade ago
they cant allow any result undermining the power of the ten master clans
i want to ask you a question
aside from us no other member as the right to raise any objections
so wat did you want to discuss
just to be sure let me ask you one thing
rougly thirty seconds had gone by
if you come across anyone else sniffing around get rid of them
should i really be seeing tis
core eidos data reading from backup
the bosss name is ricard sun
unfortunately it seems tat sibas concerns were dead on
friends
one arrest
such a powerful surge as tatow on earth did you
hows tms ciyodas condition
and thats how ill win
lets see
theyre allies
times
observe my secret
to old immense responsibility in is decisions
for you to sow interest in a girl masaki
except they are collateral descendants of the famous onmyoji clang kamo
flowers wick colour the town
but complying wit your requests
sizuku did you master tat
antinite is mined exclusively for military use anyway
not even getting a glimpse of any other players bands besides icijos is another blow
i came ere to be alone
wat in the world was tat about
accessing toe basic system files is hard enough in itself
we have no intention of using magicians as literal components
however no effective method of addressing tis issue as been found
fulfilled is duty as her guardian did e
since youve come to see tis match in order to take your mind off your race
you two really get along well dont you
fine ten lets send you on your way
the load should be lighter once wemake toe ardware do part of the job
let the tsurumi and fujisawa units handle the sweep of the enemy remnants
at the magic geometry preparation room
begin the test
the whole world would plunge into anarchy
its not at all far fetched tat they could uncover and expose my identity as silver
an incident tat marked the ascension of magic over mechanical and abc weapons
leo i want you on defense
hattori kiriara i want you to wear bullet proof vests
why is it tat you close to forfeit toe rookie event and gave me be the substitute
wat do you think taurus silver is like siba kun
our schools gravity control type termonuclear reactor takes advantage of tis
im too slow
adding up to a total of ten days
there are spirits swarming around yosidas robe
ill carefully listen to your excuses later
it was not magic
hes a fellow student at first high and a teammate right
like a maze stopping and going
how do you feel
theres no light wave noise at all
while tat possibly cant be ruled out entirely
aim and pull the trigger
tat brought on something akin toad violent bout of seasickness
some ignorant souls certainly do try to ridicule my brother
still the match is not over yet
if you call me pony
theyve started playing the last song
youre about the only person wo would call me a lady
apparently i cant afford to lose tis next match
we dont avez ranks anymore
roger tat ill be on the lookout myself
will take place in teopen plains stage
listen the guard detail for tat demo device and stuff
brother
in tat case as you wish
a random attacker can just be a magician passing by
they were only using you mibu senpai
people might even get hurt
flight magic
he says es going to borrow toe videos from the tournament staff
we didnt go so far as to take lives
well about tat jumonjis negotiating right now
tis isnt over by a long sot
wed just like to ear your reason for trailing us
so es cardinal george u
actually tis time were going to beat you
it was small scale magic launched instantaneously at minimum output levels
vibration type close combat magic
at tis rate toe yotsubas will become too powerful
our guys might be in need of a boost
would you care to have a mock battle wit me
to be precise theyre probably after the magic associations main database
please use a mask
so we decided to old an opendiscussion tomorrow after school
wick allow im to read and analyzeactivation sequences wit great accuracy
my view is dizzy
instead of ordering your tools around
give me fifteen minutes
youre very very wrong
major kazama you have a guest
youre right
tatsuya im counting on you to keep tis up for the other matches too
like a maze stopping and going
i didnt know you were ere
be careful tatsuya
i cant wait
going one on one its possible tat i could defeat the queen of the igt marya yotsuba
he made a wise decision
but why how did tis happen
right now youre a iger priority
and the ydrogen gas now cooled to optimum levels is sent to a eat sink thank
be sure to acquire it no matter wat
the message i wished for to raise my ope
engraved sequences
o man
its rude to say things like tat you know
tat apron
and siba ill kick your ass if you tell her anything
silver sama youre my hero
you shouldnt speak ill of your mother
mus akajo as taken the other students to the underground tunnel
sorry im supposed tomeet up wit my sister
ten youre asking the school to find more faculty
youre right
im sure erika and mizuki will be great friends
so it is impossible to surprise you u
since last year ses been dealing wit the gap between her accolades as a kendoist
but we practised and tougt of your strategy together
weve been recalculating our projections for winning toe overalls title
its going according to the plan
lets go somewhere wit more room
i won tatsuya sand
tat would certainly frustrate me
youd make a fortune if you patented tat
you cant use perpetual magic for tat long
second lieutenant fujibayasi you join the main unit
for your information i cant do network casting
tis was almost certainly due to magic interference from within the water
hey were all girls so wat are you saying
its people would be neglected equally
the officers of the student council arecosen from among the course students
we dont avez much time but if theres even a little discomfort ill adjust it as much as possible
in other words youd cast excess magic
a booster tat expands a magicians capacity would also be a treat to the military
sadly there will definitely be fistfigts and dangerous magic being used
loop casting was an inspired idea
and they end up trying not to enter the dark areas
siba kun is your cahd a silver horn
the one wo created tat emotionless pony image
tis is turning from a debates to mayumi having a speech
i block out all reasoning
tatsuya kun wat do you think
i heard tis from sizuku
a st course upperclassman
look theres an empty plate over there
is tis the sample
the enemy is using anti magician gig speed rounds
well i did hurt kiriara kun
the military owns tis hotel doesnt it
we came all tis way only to be left on the sidelines wat a bummer
the winner toe runner upland the third place finiser
the eidos is restored to its state before the injury occurred
starting tis afternoon all membersare to wear bullet proof vests
since youve done everything to paved the way to victory for me
you truly are an annoying woman
i can see tat youre stressed
self acceleration
we have something to talk to her about
it didnt seem tat way to me
you wont be able to go wit your friends tough
he said e was tired out
to congratulate me forstarting gig school they said
how cowardly
so something in our school right
good sign u
dont worry youre just being loyal to your mission
i was trying to help you do just tat
just like a dream
its a little untidy but eyd find yourself a seat somewhere
at the end of the day mirage brat is all about stamina
wo are those two to your brother anyway
beauty disappears wit time
how many players are in the next obstacle
if you need me give me a call
even if youre being spiteful you shouldnt say stupid brother
the goal is to copy toe settings on kiriara senpais cahd to the competition standard cahd
is there some kind of problem
but your basic concept is the same isnt it
illusion magic
master youve clearly rattled miyuki
and the development of a perpetual motion device based on the model of unlimited inertial expansion
the speed of tat tecnique is a sure treat
tis match is decided before it even begins
a speech by a fresman
however casting such a spell wouldnt have any real influence
it as noting to do wit you
everyone get down
tatsuya sans tuning is professional level
ill take you to your room
it cant be right
roger
disciplinary committee officersso they can score points for themselves
in tat case lets have miyuki sang and tatsuya swan come over tat day too
thats right
aim and pull the trigger
the message in my grasp gives me ope
the schools got two kinds of the ten masters
whereas the enemy fleet as already finished mobilizing
an original sequence written by siba kun
since ive got to go back to guard duty
im sure youll find it rewarding
so ses also using vibration magic
our army suffered greatly until its true form was identified
miyuki im going to let down some ropes so will you grab onto stem
by the way tis as noting to do wit toe counseling but
leo are you free today
thats not really much of an issue
jsdf independent magic equipped battalion
but now es using oscillation type magic
the world population plunged down to tree billion
of course its always possible tat its just a coincidence
onii sama youve made the impossible possible again
i wonder
seven people down already
the pilosopers stone serves as a catalyst in spells tat convert base metals into precious metals
we still have to reearsebuild the presentation models
just yesterday one of them said youll never be our equal
you are using an electromagnetic oscillationsequence wick generates a series of flashes
is the disciplinary committee responsible for the security
to drive someone to the brink and ten follow trougon your own youre quite the brilliant gigolo
when middle school girls received money from middle aged men to
open the gates
so wat was it tat you wanted to talk about
its a magic competition in wick physical attacks are banned
wo knew tat you could use illusion magic tis way
brother
apparently they no longer care how it looks
of course the kind of responsibility a guy takes for a girl
after the second match it seems outer schools were worried about creating
break time
relax ibu
as long as they arent students
not now
pixie standby in suspend mode
it is incorrect to say tat the administration is favoring first division students on the basis of club budgets
was tat attack also ninjutsu ten
ill take care of the fire
all right
cairwoman congratulations on winning the speed shooting event
sorry could you say tat again
or rather your auras are similar
you probably need to be ready to kill or be killed
but the situation is prater murky isnt it
however if you were able to deduce all of tat and still close to come ere
disciplinary officers are permitted to carry their cards wit stem
reading core eidos data from backup
everyone calm down
if tat happens they could very well be forced into a head on clash underground
could the cracker have been after
its heading sount down sagaminada at knots
there are explicit limitations on watkinds of magic you are allowed to use
embracing earths piled up memories
is just empaty between people in the same plight
brother
as just been ordered to add our support to the defense
its simply tat people dontunderstand your unique talent
if it really is capable of storing magic sequences
a new day is dawning
not the least of wick is illegal activities
and wit tat spell ses ancoring its relative position
help out wit my work tat was par for the course
for now theyve been reconnected wit magic but they advent set yet
so naturally it shouldnt be me but you
in our school we say those people can see the gods
told miyuki a candidate for the leaderof toe yotsubas a speculation as a fact
some people got hurt didnt they
kiriara kun theres still over an ourbefore toe swordsmansip clubs turn
like a stalker
everybody come wit me
but as for now im feeling
right there were traces of magic
one week for a full recovery
haruka kun is my student
just before tms watanabe lost her balance the waters surface was seen to cave inward unnaturally
im sure tat theyve mustered a volunteer army so im going to join up
weve succeeded in securing an on site collaborator
honoka you have a nice figure
even if tis wisp doesnt need any magic
they dont want to let go of magic
tis is just insurance right
speed is a crucial factor for casting
he created tree waves each wit a different frequency
se likes to intermix variousfragrances by manipulating air flow
aside from fine tuning cards
even if it could break the waters surface
from wat i understand about the situation
the prince of icijou is impressive as expected
o need to fuss
captain yanagi please refrain from any direct attacks on the enemy sip
onii sama i
yes brother
and tis is the best i can do
my brother as certainly acknowledged you
idiots stop it
youve been perusing alcemy related documents a lot lately
in tis situation we should get out
leo you secure us a way out
sorry to take up your time
its all right
instead theyre casting a wide net
watched
of course the schools reputations are at stake
and last night we were able to obtain crucial combat data
i look forward to working wit you all
either wit modern magic or ancient magic
did e really alter the structure of is activation sequences in a mere two ours
here tis early
were staying on alert for the rest of today
a strong bond ties us together as siblings
id like to keep tis conversation off the record
consciousness interference type non systematic magic
im sure se wouldnt have been hurt anyway
so im one of the guinea pigs
thanks to you we canlaunc our next operation
the tecnical feasibility of a gravity control type magic termonuclear fusion reactor
there are no strange feelings at all
and activated poison gas or caused an explosion
my tougts are in distortion
ill get dinner started right away
ill have to comply
you know how they say tat money talks
some family business correct
b but cairwoman it was siba wo drove you to the brink
was kiriara toe onlyone wo used magic
wat is required to actualize nuclear power
i im a little surprised tough
thats right
and your little sister can definitely win an official match
but rather the result of extensive physical training
official points are worth twice as much as rookie points
do you think tat it might have been spirit magic tatsuya
very well ill read over teretomorrow morning
is e any good
all right ten shall i ear wat you have to say
if you need time ten come back ere in an our
as a member of the ten master clans
im sorry senpai
but it wasnt a allucination
my young students of magic
i agree wit maria
has magic always been the only thing tat defined you as a person
he wont take the time to sneer at you never mind sympathize wit you
heres my take on it wick is conjecture layered over a ypotesis
teamwork is crucial after all
if you wish to do so
beauty disappears wit time
a flight device
and lets not forget to communicate
tatsuya and to have been severely injured by icijos illegal excessive attack
master kokonoe and the digest praise for you
at any rate if youre the doing the peeking
if you infuse psions in the beginning and while attacking
the two remaining preliminary matches have been postponed till tomorrow is tat right
theyre not spats
one just up the stairs
and would you mind leaving for today
you were right tat toe testmeasured your ability incorrectly
being accepted to the magic high school attached to the national magic university
sure be my guest
so intriguing
i decided to pick you because
the committee as already inspected our devices
even if we use my magic theres no guarantees tat it can be replicated
stir yourselves those of you wo possess magic
a gentle sunlight shines
my name is mikiiko
yea im off duty today looks likeim finally getting some downtime
thats a promise okay
would normallyresult in suspension
selecting a substitute from among the staff despite the availability of other players
and our second match is against fourth high wo are dead last so far
and based on the lap times from last years final
well its against the ethics of the profession
its none of your business
they arent wrong when they say im incompetent
voice activation was tat really necessary
they would have arranged a different guardian if you hadnt gone to the school wouldnt they
is the successive processing of activation sequences okay
even counter magic wont do the trick
yes im very sorry brother
nobody can cast a sequence wit two cards
they dont know tatsuya sans true skills
youre very welcome
roger
by rupturing is eardrums and damaging is semicircular canals
these terrorists tried to attack my private space
even if i choose from outside the team
you have the silver horn wit you today
the weather is ideal for mirage bait
so siba did design tat activation sequence
speed complexity and strength
yes right before my board sank into the water
are you saying tat it wasnt due to those tree girls personal skills
do you know those people
aim and pull the trigger
you probably know our names anyway
are you two really just siblings
you seem well faster
i dont think we ever did
tat information was really useful
how did the sweep operation go
for the nine magic university attached gig schools across the country
outing to worry about
they certainly may be
a new day is dawning
sonic blade
anyway waits wit tat attitude of yours
of course not miyuki
well not tat im going to be making excuses like tat
you can count on me to make sure everyone escapes
ten be my guest
because youre my one and only commander
and worse objective is to embed magicians into the military system
aim and pull the trigger
and es a world renowned programmerfor is work on the loop casting system
i cant wait
sorry to be rude but is tat intel reliable
its also unlikely tat it was caused by delayed magic
it might be a countermeasure against the invisible bullet
onii sama im going to make us some coffee
and in most cases the magic doesntactivate you all know tat right
mibu you feel wat any nd course student would
interesting
standing around and talking ere will disturb other people
it would be best to only engage inself study whilst under proper supervision
luckily mayumi and juumonji the club management group representatives
even if theres an end
spirits
i tougt about it
it looked like spirits bursting apart
begin
so they vehemently bring the struggle to the very extreme
the magic high school attached to the national magic university
such beautiful magic
means tat im part of the elite few wit notables and rare magic skills
aim and pull the trigger
its not as if your approach is going to change compared to the prelims
however if you are found using it for anything outside of your duty
should i help
its possible tat an agent was riding underwater
even if something goes wrong the safety device souled kick in
well today wasnt as bad as tat it was a breeze by comparison
please wait a moment
it as a subtle undeniable charm
antinite is extremely rare
after all there still might be some remnants hiding on campus
my view is dizzy
if you believe tat one of those decisions is flawed
let go of her
weve won the rookie event
did you make tat lunch yourself
tat enable you to render your opponentpowerless while sustaining the least damage
well be competing in monolit code tomorrow
so youve got a brother complex erika
wat was the incident
optimized specifically for loop casting
im kidding of course
im the one wo recommended you siba
hes in charge of foreign criminal organisations
in tat case will you let me go on guard duty too
a gripping message etats rising ope
initializing automatic repairs sequence
already tatsuya is one of our forces invaluable asserts
it wasnt much of an injury to begin wit
wo wouldve tougt you werean academic industrial spy
is tat toe toy from before
look out
the tesis is the first concrete step towards tat
id like to take you up on tat sizuku
at tis rate everyone might start to panic
siba as the competency necessary for a representative of our school
miyuki tat was no accident
or even in magic
elfin sniper
onaggressive defense policy sure is a pleasant way to put it
my view is dizzy
he knows wat es doing
well be submitting everything to the kanto branch of the magic association
brother is capable of restoring them in an instant
so the results are more or less satisfactory
brother
a new day is dawning
hello so we meet again
hey rind would you take onte role of an engineer after all
thats not wat tis is
and mizukis waising dishes
wo took out all those magic orientedclub regulars without using magic yourself
thats a fact
even if the match is set on the open plains stage
im fine wit whatever else happens
sorry kei ill be right back
it wouldnt result in a wave big enough to trow watanabe senpai off balance
the only reason e laughed was because you corse a weird way to put it
i even ditced school to train tis guys butt off
in one instant
the one tat might have the ability to store magic sequences
physical blows are forbidden arent they
youre the one being rude
they call themselves a social movement
most likely to side the fact tat magic was being used
okay ten wat is your type
you should never be remiss in your efforts to improve your magic skills
if we werent related i wouldnt mind being lovers
so let me give you a word of advice
take command on locations
dont worry wateverappens ill be fine
youre calling it an errorbut wasnt it mibus intent
stop you fool
honing your skills means constantly incorporating new tecniques
suddenly theres no mercy
its not a lie
you are not permitted to addresssecond division students as weeds
youre blooms but right now how are you any better than us
it is preferred tat you stoptem before any magic is used
you bastard
it suits you really well
so dr asuka waits her condition
you cant do it without really understanding the devices nos
terrorists
surely its no socker tat i know about im
thats something the police should be dealing wit
we did just get off to a good start today after all
commendable just one day
ibu do you want to fight wit real swords
a brand new school uniform gives off an innocent feeling
theyre masking their goal
at the beginning of the st century it was turned into real tecnology
im the acting master clang conference representative for the jumonji clang katsuto jumonji
a new day will come
miyuki are you enjoying gig school
tat creates a wave of psyons
if it becomes a burden to you
are you prepared to learn something like tat
i have breakfast prepared for you
however in tis school
staff members contestants please come to the main all
the yotsubas have used their magicians as weapons including themselves
two of the boys races are over and they both missed the cut
sink the enemy vessel using material burst
over my dead body
wat is it honoka
kiriara senpai a man is not is face
o way
or do you plan on reporting over a tirdof the student body to administration
altoug i cant really say why
o wonder youre our brain
its so moe
wo knew tat master lu
dont inhale the smoke
and her evaluation as a course student
is an honour tat makes me very happy
you mean it would be registered as a new type of magic
so a part time operator right
the solution should not bringabout any more discrimination
would it be all right to ask you two questions
for example
if theres a fight the disciplinary committee as to stop it by using force
long ago in the age of immorality
wat a coincidence
wat is it miyuki
honoka if you get nervous now you wont make it till your race
and going for the actualization of an intermittent nuclear reaction troug
it makes a full copy of the eidos from up to ours before the damage was received
wo ten benefits from the fall of japan
the memories of joining our hearts together
id like you to join the student council
tat woman is a mokuroku im an inka
but president
tis goes far beyond the reckless surfing in tat battle board race
you seemed to be reading the activation sequence and writing the magic sequence at the same time
excuse me but im your boss
is it true tat you verbally abused the second year mibu in the cafe yesterday
as an aspiring magic engineer the state of tis room is unbearable
we should be trying to end discrimination among images
sorcery boosters
yes tatsuya it is wat you think
its the same concept behind a elm splitter
miyuki swan your magic power is really something
they are leaving the locations after picking up her classmates and underclassmen
a ninjutsu user
these two are my classmates
so theyre under the false impression tat the water route ends at the border between the light and dark areas
gravity control type magic is used in flying type magic as well
or as my aunt formally chosen my sister to be heir to the family
im going to explain the rules now
ground transportations completely paralyzed as well
sleeping gas
im major harunobu kazama of the jsdf
not wanting the rest of us to worry
it seems deception is another
its no surprise tat people wouldsuspect us of abusing tat power
maria you got troug to the battle board semi finals too didnt you
creating a pulse similar to a triangular wave
sitting next to me is our treasurersuzune iciara aka grin
but really aunt marya theres no cause for concern
hes like a monolit
tat morisaki boy
but unfortunately im not quite there yet
aim and pull the trigger
every time brother deals someones wounds
just like a dream
there is noting common about anyone in magic high schools
good to be working wit you too
please come to the competition tomorrow
or maybe ses taking it out on tatsuya
to sowcase their research on magic theory and magic engineering
come in
you go on and watch saegusas match
first let me apologize for making you a party to my prank
there were many conflicts over energy resources
how do you feel
you can call me tatsuya of course
if a world disregarded talent and uniqueness entirely
we assign each element a single color
can you snipe someone from a thousand metres at night using only an optical scope
its a little embarrassing but military accounting data was leaked
how many players are in the next obstacle
and as such talk of marriage and engagement are still far from my mind
two near the bottom of the stairs
my brothers training under a ninjutsu user kokonoe yakumo sensei
i will always be on your side brother
raise our grades u
at the very least they should be peerless at the rookie level
unfortunately it would appear tati dont spare your principles tms mibu
when it happened were you being hindered by a third party using magic
bad tuning can cost lives
o young master
under all tat pressure to be able to curn out those spells wit suck accuracy
given tat i believe i must offer you my sincere gratitude
if their luck holds out they wont die otherwise
and tat takes extremely complex sequences tat require activation sequences
president take the back door wit kiriara senpai
so my instincts are in a silent frenzy
as for the girls tms mitsui twos in the final race is sure to qualify
my tougts are in distortion
as a counsellor at first magic high school
yes wit basic single system level
my instincts rage quietly
pixie starting now record the situation in the room using monitoring mode
president are you not feeling well
not in one go mr yosida
thats why flight magic is realistically impossible
were good
confirming restore point
well i just got tat feeling
weak magic when used intuitively
but im not sure tat theyll agree to do it
but even so i believe tat theres no one wo can defeat you brother
requiring a magician only for the initial activation can be actualized
theres been a spikes in the number of eastern spies going after magic engineering
had you not tried to hurt my brother
hey tatsuya wait
i heard kiriara senpai stopped by every day
inspector
i call im tatsuya too
dont remind her of her brother
sizuku wick of the events being held tomorrow do you recommend
the same as tms watanabe
aim and pull the trigger
first to convert toe ydrogen serving as fuel into plasma
if it were purely a test of power id probably lose to tms siba
want me to refer you to a good counsellor
reinforcement magic
self restoration sequence auto start
brother heres a towel
the ciyoda family is known to be skilled in long range solid matter vibration type magic
a sketc of a sad little mouse wo was used by a fox
ive never tougt of im as a potential love interest
we were originally going to have tms iciara mr isori
but once again ive caused troublefor you and its all my fault
come in
the magic association branch office
is a criminal offense
a new day will come
o problem
thats not a good reason to fight wit your life
fujibayasi swan is it okay for you to come to the first high waiting room
whoever can cast toe quickestwins in a battle between images
one of us would ever let a fellow student put is life on the line
not if it means getting one over tat guy
were engaged in a battle
each point as been numbered
it seems similar to working wit zone interference
o way
but we need to do something about balance
is solely due to the handful wo possess skills tat are essential to society
sensei you can eat wit us if you want
ive been notified tat ate some country will be sending us a warsip
he is a magician wit experience in live combat
actually im honored tat tms pantom as such a keen interest in me
an important secret seems to always be beckoning me
if we loiter ere too long well probably be captured by the enemy
utterly ridiculous
dont be so reserved
roger tat
ive trained wit just my sword for years
so you can only ope for at most ten lawyers
bright sakura petals dance in the air
subject is stationary
i see
wo wouldve tougt tat toe electron sorceress knew about the likes of me
well im just raving luncwit mizuki and tatsuya
aim and pull the trigger
the room temperature plasma device operated without a itch
tis year were interested in seeing if first high will win their tired consecutive campionsip
im not confident enough to mess around wit a unique cahd like tat
ill be rooting for you
the morisaki clang is famous for their quick draw tecnique
tough miyuki and sizuku will have you for both their events
in two different events
we learned tat eyd been subjected to mind control
everyone on guard duty good work today
your unnecessary compassion wont hurt only you
whose rare talent in magicas been acknowledged right
but at the same time your own achievement cant be denied
were coming in
well you know kanons personality
ten as per the clean meeting
how do you know about o head dragon
but thats a preposterous theory
both internal affairs and public safety were happier than expected wit last nights souvenir
we are confident tat a gravity control type termonuclear reactor
the second match target passed the qualifiers
thats right ive never heard of a generalized device in rifles form
regardless of the standings in the final
youre right
a gentle breeze a blooming bud
just nowtat attack
kiriaras cahd as iger specs than those reserved for the teachers
rather than being an active ingredient itself
gives im incredibly strong presence
the whole countrys magicaltecnology is at our fingertips

underground tunnel
its the ten master clans responsibility to protect tis country
drawing attention to your right and by removing your glasses
after retiring from the army mibu transferred to the cabinet information management agency

the commander said its almost time to settle the problem
wo can blame her if theres still a sense of resentment in her heart

the site of the competition is in the south eastern area of fuji exercise grounds
you can win over them without help from anyone
tis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to end the unjust treatment tat we have been receiving
we need more intel

tis is just a stop gap measure all right
theres simply no way to hide oneself one hundred percent
im not sure wat it is tat you want to ear
fresman representative siba miyuki
the great asian alliances magic combat power will skyrocket

my visions are still blinded
the mobile suit we discussed as been completed
lets sing our love
you successfully captured tease intruders wit your magic
its all right ive left it in hanzos bands
tell me waits going on
tell me in secret later okay
but at the same time the system cant be one tat blinds toe magician
does our school not have many people from common families
is everything fine wit toe tesis competition
its a report about the tree great practical problems of weight type magic
but onii sama in order to deal wit all these people at once
why did you try to steal tat data
youre from the ciba family
you just really wanted to see it right tatsuya kun
group leader juumonji wat do you think
sure tinge ten call me leo
sekimoto isao take out your card and put it down on the floor
military might alone violence alone theyre not enough
erika calm down a little
everyone in the school knows you by now
maria be careful
ill take anyone wo can get the job done
i think youre being paranoid onii sama
but the prelims are going on without us and fourth high anyway
a gentle breeze a blooming bud
tat girls super acute isnt se
but there actually is such a thing as a generalized device wit integrated auxiliary sights
o dont worry about tat
se was the runner up in the girls middle school kendo campionsip two years ago
siba you should join the ten master clans
theyve cut off the power so they wontbe doing any more broadcasting
thats right we only need a little of her time
sum u actually im not feeling up to it
we won the first match
ive asked them to come ere to help solve the riddle of the underwater operative
s sure im ready my race isnt till the afternoon anyway
there were tree in all and they were all armed wit andguns
in order to take my eyes off of your left and while you activated your cahd
an information broker so to speak
yosidas a magician igly skilled in spirit magic
right now im the only one you can communicate wit from tat room
it seems tat we can just leave her be without problems
do you have any plans for lunch
brother
you really disappoint me
those course guys i ear theyre totally pissed off about tis
you didnt pull any punces wit tat advice did you
my view is dizzy
and those words didnt raise any questions in your mind
so check how it feels after tat
isnt tat one of the tree great puzzles of weight type magic
so it can take any kind of punishment u
aim and pull the trigger
still why do you
tis isnt fair
a new day will still come
is tis really the time for a crisis of confidence
brother
but it looks like our results in the rookie matches will sway our chances for the overalls title
my view is dizzy
yes such a lamentable culture does exist ere
specifically wat is it tat you want them to improve
tatsuya dont tell me youre planning to take them on in battle
he also as psion radiation hypersensitivity
a watanabe was way scarier after the mock battle
weapons are not allowed
their slogan is elimination of discrimination by images
i understand maria
were detecting horizontal acceleration
or is it different from the ancient magic of tis country
to allow for extra time to have mr tsuzura go over our submission
it looks like her opponent as switched to an offense first strategy but
video of a cooperator and their hacking tool
onii sama are you all right
and the third was applied upwards diagonally to catapult toe car
fine wit me
miyuki did you finish your business wit the student council
cardinal georges invisible bullet as the flaw of requiring visual confirmation of is target
tatsuya wat time are you leading to the convention center tomorrow
as a final note ill ask you again
in our communications wit toe mobile unit we picked up the word maesvara
the thing is fortune deserted us and my second in command as fallen into the enemys hands
o excuse me
im watanabe maria from the disciplinary committee
depending on the outcome you couldve gotten yourself expelled you know
first a spell tat blew out the tires on the car
im sure tat youre up to the task brother
a study was conducted using the concept you described
just like it was tat day
our victory is almost a dead certainty
meaning tat passe was successful
and an activation sequence wit the opposite effect using the other
also get her to carry a gun too
youre taking tis too lightly sir
you can do things tat nobody else in the world can do
im sorry about wat happened
but cant because tatsuya swan is ere
it might be easier than we think to pinpoint wo the enemy is ere
there is an entity tat is trying to take magic away from tis country
really
brother
o of course not
roger
its no use expecting suctings of my brother erika
to counter tms mitsuis optical magic its the most affordable sure fire strategy
isnt tat clearly a criminal act
so id love to have the elpof a certain mound dog
tat tougtfulness of yours is to be respected i know
promise me onii sama
tat man said so too
you do know wat you have to do to win monolit code dont you
an unsaken world a heartless condition
and besides weve got the edge in battle board so far
dont you think its too simple
wat do you say jyumonji
they said tat its necessary for me to stay ospitalised for a little bit more
your swordsmansip club replies entirely on magic to do anything
material burst might not do you any good
hey dwy would you bring tat guys name up at a time like tis
siba kun would you join the kendo club
the student council is leading preparations for the competition
but my tougts are distorted
will tat girl be all right
my apologies
ill introduce you later
are we allowed to use the committees cards
reviewing the curriculum and registering for lectures
it says tat they already settled it
magic is a means not a goal in and of itself
wat are you planning on doing
i ear its a criminal syndicate based in hong kong
my love for im would never change
tis is the end of the line
isnt tat proof tat preferential treatmentfor course students is overlooked
it was just orseplay tat got out of and
tat tms watanabe was the victim of illegal magic interference by a third party
can you do tat wit spirit magic
or well view you as being in leagues wit the invaders
saegusa you cant go
but right now our top priority should be to get rid of tat brat
erika at school im still your senior you know
a gripping message etats rising ope
tatsumi your choice of words mayrun afoul of the banned words regulations
but tatsuya kun really can use it cant e
it was student council businessrigt dont worry about it
its the same as always
use your ring
isnt tat a dangerous position
hey tatsuya
and the sequences power to rewrite the information of the target
and we were to clash wit no limitations on either side
whats going on wit battle board
the enemy fleet as been annihilated or rather
even if i told you you wouldnt understand
as long as theres no tecnique to directly remove a magic sequence
if tat was just an accident too
youll just be in the way if you plant yourself twere forever
sir theres no need to think so hard about it
not only tat but wit toe added perk of having to watch out for interference by an unknown entity
se as astounding magic power
wat right do you have trying to split these two apart
its to overthrow the precedents
the amount of data in a single activation sequence
youre most likely the most prodigious engineer in the history of the line schools competition
are you patrolling toe site
im sorry inspector
reaction force not detected on the floor
the kind of move tat can kill your opponent for sure
you need to draw a line between st course and nd course
youd think it was taurus silver himself
miyuki is something the matter
tis will be our first time seeing is engineering skills in an actual match
thats making tease moves on tis years pine schools competition
onii sama i brought coffee
its still too early for tat
siba is there a problem
wat is your business today
i dont think we can choose our means any more but wo knows
youre a whole our and a half late
why are they moving away when the monolit just opened up
you know how you never give me any special treatment
are you uncomfortable around women scion of the ciba clang
the unclouded gaze
and we were talking about im
thats the best possible outcome
so we tie strategy staff have decided to sacrifice the newcomer events somewhat
theyre not anything tat should be allowed to exist in tis world
however tatsuya on is own is an assent on the level of a strategic missiles
but as such theyll eventually be dejected from the world of mankind
id like to have a greater variety ofanti personnel binding sequences
if you think magic is almighty
the needed phenomenon interfering magic increases each time
ten just as we tougt toe accident tat day
it was tis delusion
altoug we certainly should bestopping tis unlawful takeover
tis is a class as problem
you overpowered them without any letal injuries in one sot
weve got the evidence
o one would complain if they had to wait inside the buds
a prank
valuable documents are used at the tesis competition
leave the stragglers to the backup unit
and its the only such natural thing left in my heart
ten please send the sample to rd division tree
its prohibited to disturb the other contestants using magic
his way of doing it is too irregular
i would expect no less of my brother
ill help you out just a little all right
but youre running out of time already arent you
well well is tis the red string of fateim seeing between you two
inferno
tatsuya at one point you canceled your magicsequence and rebuilt it from scratch didnt you
being accepted into tis state run school dedicated to teaching magic tecnicians
ill teach you a thing or two about knowing your place
potential you mean theres a problem wit my current abilities
so theyre trying hard to keep tis secret
tomorrows discussion may old
weve already rolled toe dice
whats your name
and sibata is gifted wit an exceptional sensitivity to pusions
the force tat affected the waters surface was generated from within the water
tat skill is something you achieved all on your own
the issue is tis barrier to awareness
naturally
the answer is
but we were good friends and roommates
just like a dream
gram dispersion
its possible
altoug i got a bit worried ere and there
anti personnel magic use outside of self defense
ten depending on our score in the official mirage brat event
o one could possibly read all tat in an instant
so you didnt see the whole sting
winner siba tatsuya
a new day will still come
brother tsugu
hey youre not really
in the next few days ill appraised the situation myself
we cant afford to be picky about our methods any more
im not really sure wat you mean by tat
were winning tomorrows monolit code no matter wat
you know im in the second divisionspecifically because my practical score was
if an easily acquired tecniqueto nullify magic spells were to spread
you two have known each other for only a week
thats good enough
the theory makes sense
cabinet name balance
se does seem extremely fired up
just the map data will do right
you should at least watch the final from the stands
wit my current powers
sum you two
can i take a look at them
you think so too hattori
escort mr jumonji to the kanto branch of the magic association
im just not qualified enough
whys tat
it was master wo asked you to transport tat not me
so the participants are chosen according to their abilities
you people incurred my wrath
look out
surely tat wouldnt sit well wit the runners up
in recognition of tis brilliant feat toe tournament committee as approached us wit a proposal
w we have no intention of interfering wit toe sic any further
of course
im not learning magic to fight anyone
se strengthened per defences
but wat do they actually mean by discrimination
tis scape
spells tat place an emphasis on speed
and analyse the magic sequence
and for the names they call us
the event e completed in was speed shooting
the bodyguard standing next toyou is insignificant in comparison
miyuki theres no reason for you to worry
to think tat someone among the tournament staff was involved in tampering
discussion about the tesis competition security
would it be possible to have my brother join wit me
will you be all right
so tat i could learnto control these eyes
but according to sibas analysis
i knew it
apparently zou is going to check on the girl today
the matriculation ceremony was yesterday
open discussionte student counciland toe students for the end of scoolwide discrimination
well tat souled only be acceptable in certain situations
so as vice cairwoman you must be busy right
ibu did the same thing
thats a bold statement ibu
theyre sitting up front
your furisode was wonderful
mus ciyoda please pick tis up tomorrow
its still just the qualifier matches
so anyway leos in the kitchen doing manual labor
thats not necessary
we have to win at least four of them
is tat president jyumonji would like to negotiate
theres noting in particular tati want the school to change
those two have the supplementary effect of enancing toe potency of the wearers magic
he was the champion in the kanto plains middle school kendo campionsip two years ago
to achieve tat wed need a way to store magic sequences
thats not wat honoka swan wants you to say
time for introductions
it looked like the adjustments to is cahd werent working for im
why would you be so reckless
as if you could ever pull tat off
brother i couldnt believe it
ten tomorrow morning report to the usual place
its only a two our trip to the dorms
like a maze stopping and going
could you please just let me go
theres something id like you to take custody of
there have been several incidents of illegal entry to the country in yokoama and yokosuka
hattori sawaki go after akajo right now
wo told you tat anyway
as expected from onii sama
any info about you is closely guarded
after all tat boy does seem to share your inward struggles
honoka our rookie events dont start till day remember
how wat i wanted to tell you
its brother tsugu isnt it
ill prepare the cards
ten its possible tat toe pilosopers stone is capable of storing magic sequences
and the others
well the tougt as crossed my mind
so the boys and girls ended up wit the opposite results didnt they
you two are always together too arent you
the tesis competition in the autumn involves scolarly research
theres no need for objects to be in contact
hes using all of is magic power for phenomenon rewriting
the knowledge we have is not all there is to the world
its sensory interference magic
miyuki siba my kind sister
ill tell you the details some other day
be careful out there
besides being tat you landed from the same eight on your feet
the tournament will have five days each of expert and rookie tournaments
furtermore e was rumored to have and one of the lowest scores on the practical test
all of us ere will be purged
thats right
im better than her wit a sword
and their sponsor the great asian union
you could just cancel toe ongoing spell and launc a new one in its place
maria the student council ereby nominatestatsuya siba to the disciplinary committee
please dont do anything too dangerous
its thanks to you tat my daughter was able to recover
we also gave one battalion each fromtsurumi and fujisawa rushing to tis site
and call any magic based judgment discrimination
the magic high school attached to the national magic university
the other two won didnt they
if the topic tms iciara had chosen was something totally unfamiliar to me
and leave mibu senpais attempted robbery to family court
because all the crucial data is being centrally managed in kyoto and yokoama
in an official match too
if thats how youre referring to me are we on a secret line
are allotted a much larger budget taen non magic sports teams
im just not sure dwy general purpose flight magic hasnt come to fruition
next slowly move orizontally
its natural for a big brother to get angry for is little sister
o her name is miyuki siba
kinoe kuns vision must have come from is ancestors
he is my brother
you might be able to
he was pretty jot dont you think
tis wouldve been much less painful
wick had been on its way to hodogaya on a separate mission
facing those two at the same time would be
im free
if tis continues the enemy will launc within two ours
because is magic calculation area is dominated by tis god like power
not bad tough guy
are you telling me tat discrimination isnt wrong
the exquisite curve wick makes it easy to draw quickly
demonic power
however theyve locked the door and barricaded themselves inside
ill see you off
okay okay rind your problem is you swing your arms in too big circles

they probably used their items to go back
well react tat lake in one flight
going to survive until the end
yes it was in charge of tis games network security
so were gonna be comrades wit the divine dragon alliance and the knights of blood
e excuse me
youll catch a cold
im glad to ear tat
if youd like please take some wit you later
everything tat just happened feels so unreal
o one it
during tat time two thousand people have died
you know how theres a flight duration limit right
so thats why you were in the woods on the nd floor
a game
lets go
and it dropped a ring tat raised ones agility by levels
please check for yourselves
were are the leaders holding their conference
damn it
just a bit more and we might make it to the front lines
you mustve kept your distance because im not your real sister
but you ended up killing toe winner the last time we did tat
hm i guess youre right
i cant just leave them
seeking but a miracle
ive arranged for yuis data to be saved to my ervegears local memory
while i do appreciate toe offers
its my first time coming to such a massive city
do you even know how much trouble it is to map stuff out
basically if you own a server wit enougbandwidt and download a copy of the seed
but i ear its prater difficult
tat man feared no one and noting
reinforcements will be ere soon
do you really think its tasty
its almost time to fight the next boss
we cant log out instantly in a neutral zone
well do our best to help you
at waits called yggdrasil or the world tree
tis time ill make it past all floors and conquer tat castle
i know ill just drip toe ervegear off my head
i know former beta testers arentcomfortable wit being in groups
if you betray me now it wont be long until you regret it
lets do our best
theres supposed to be a neutralmining town midway were we can rest
the result was in favor of selling it
youre a system administrator after all
its almost like ses a baby
o the ervegear as an internal battery
seeking but a miracle
just within the game tough
anyway let them settle tis themselves
i is tat andmade
do you remember wat happened to you
if you spoil it like tat it wont be much of a game head
i go berserk during a battle and forget wat happened afterward
go into the training of players on the middle floors
how about tis
ill old on to these steadfast vows
sugu i
you tried to do wat i couldnt
besides you need to make some friends
having an orange indicator for a day or two means noting to me
o way
is tis an event
my name
are you leaving now
we only aimed to share information and food equally among as many players as possible
se mustve talked to us wit toe dagger stuck in her back the whole time
he resigned as ceo and is basically retired
so id like to make a deal wit you
i havent seen you around lately
dont get carried away
o if anything
you said to give them just one mount to be all lovely dovey
sorry looks like the deals off
its probably nighttime in the real world
but tat brat doesnt have the guts to put on the ervegear ever again
i was monitoring your position on the map
i will be the one to decide tat
i itd be double the experience
ive found my chef
it was more than enough reason to
tat lets play tat head
ten ill do the same for you later
the dragon eats toe crystals wick get refined in its belly
you just dont understand how generous i am
so i wouldve trusted you
will you be all right
the obvious suspects would be those wo voted against selling the ring
i can do even better
right now tens of thousands of players are enjoying tis game
its more than just a bug
please enter your gender andte name of your character
they will never regain consciousness
eliminated single andedly bydual wielder in consecutive strikes
its a different one from a game called alfeim online
i should stop talking or the poison will wear off
yea should be
do you love papa
im sure ell come to see you in your wedding dress
i forgot tat a long time ago
the spear wasnt lowering caynzs hap but the armors durability
the signals emitted by the ervegears transmitter are really the same as microwaves
hey its been a while everyone
o im going too
wat happened to the people still in the game
ill be responsible for her safety
i only realized it thirty minutes ago
i was overwhelmed by your attacksso i used the systems over assist mode
is sword art online your first mmo
can we really make it all the way to the top
o clue
unable to do anything else i only continued monitoring the mental exalt of players
damn it
well lets have a late lunch
the truth is the guidebook tat was just mentioned and information about it in its latest version
ill beat im and put an end to tis world
will give me strength in tis dark world
you killed your wife for a reason like tat
yes therell simply be a mild knockback effect
first theyd be able to prevent the alliance
the truth is we appraised the spear tat caynz swan was killed wit
did tat person look familiar
ill old on to these steadfast vows
the gilded hero
and so does shimmering it wit radius
ill buy you all some time so get out of ere now
if the dragon appears make sureyou hide behind some crystals
ive beard tat the flower at its summit can resurrect a familiar
can i ask you something
its a different game called alfeim online
thats the damage output tat the seven of you can muster
yuri can u
was tat se was at tokorozawasi general hospital in saitama prefecture
y youre kidding me
dont worry
youve been training tis late at night
a beta tester you said
i heard something about a bunch of players wo broke the limit by flying piggybacked
yes youre coming wit me to collect the metal
of course not
use teleportation crystals to escape wit yuri and the others right now
information maybe
whats tat feather
tis feels kind of strange
does tat mean we can exercise gm privileges wit tis
papa mamma
commence the attack
you will join the knights of blood
have you been practicing onii can
well go to the town of beginnings to see if se as any parents or siblings
the far sounding crime of a bell carried a solitary tone
o so you guys are participating too
id consider myself lucky i guess
hes the son of a good friend of mine
it might be possible to manipulates tougts emotions and even memories
his name is skains
tat says something about the party etats coming after us
you never fight up frontso do you even need crystals
my motto is buy cheap sell cheap
hey youre being too soft kirito
its cold
and es not my master hes papa
ill old on to these steadfast vows
y you mean astral type monsters right
utwoots presents
of course
youve gotta be kidding me
at tis rate its just a matter of time before is hap runs out
its not a ghost
does tat feather
tis is a new event tat wasnt in the beta
one of those pictures snowed something strange
and opened my eyes to future possibilities
i think tis world is a copy of sword art onlines server
land of fairies u
yea and we finally made it
judging from her equipment its hard to imagine tat se goes out to the field every day
i swear youre weird
ill be going come now
sorry silica
the divine dragon alliance
we were called the black cats of the igt
but you slept even longer than i did
ill old on to these steadfast vows
as long as you have pinas soul its still possible to resurrect der
when you ran in there to save those front guys
paralysis
you did it
but aincrad is were we live right now
papa mamma thank you
h how old is your sister
the chance to fight me one on one right ere right now
im more than grateful for the information
so you can remember the spells by their effects
h hello
lately tereve been some days werei dont even think about the outside world
its been a sort but fun ride
well we did spend over two years inside a brutal life or death game
i its freezing
there are around fifty mirror servers now
k kirito sand
was like an act of atonement
so in a field like tis itll be practically impossible to located
i cant rely on sword skills i can only trust in myself
countless objects have changed the sky
well wit tis the jobs done
tis is keita
in some other world tat castle truly exists
tis is
yes thats right
weve been away from the front lines for two days
as an calf you can fly as much as you want
delicious
its too funny
im back to tis world
its time to settle tis
i could barely contain my laughter
tat in itself is nobodys fault
these are grogwa seeds suburb leaves and kalim water
when youre about to lose love tat you just obtained
about from were tat man isobserving us and administering tis world
there isnt a soul etats seen the commanders hap drop to the yellow zone
address me as his highness the fairy king oberon
i wouldnt have tried to forget about you by falling in love wit kirito kun either
remember you and to touch your body all over
im sasamaru
he probably tired some red players wospecialize in dirty work to do the actual killing
starburst stream
id like it if you made an official decision now
well have to work card again starting tomorrow
the dual wielding skill is granted to the player wit toe fastest reflexes
h hum
were completely broke now tough
the prices of metals have risen as of late
i sense players
itd be a waste to spend a day like tis in a dungeon
i didnt know the t floor would be an icy zone
even faster
lets go to all sorts of places and do all sorts of things okay
do you think it makes sense for there to be
well have to assemble toe thank players and gave them switc often
well tis isnt sao
s sure sting
and put it in the guilds soared inventory
in safe areas a players hap wont normally drop
well youre ten times luckier since you got to participate in the beta
besides you dont have the luxury to be worrying about others right now
make the most of your last meeting wit per hero boy
about my amazing adventure today
you cant work tat hard for someone you dont like
the core programs and grapics formats of both games are identical
i know
well id very much appreciate tat
everything is an experience
the battle were you showed me how human will can transcend a system
igt vision magic u
well ten we can continue our talk tomorrow if thats fine wit you
so i always considered im as close as family
im afraid
one of the seven other members of golden apple
its bad manners to pry into the skill sets of others
pretty soon buying our own house will no longer be a dream
their aim probably runs on different algoritms taen outer monsters
shaking off any anxieties tat clung to me
you got grimlock sank to make you those two weapons didnt you
o its noting
so from my standpoint tis situation is extremely convenient
im starting to believe it now tat weve seen it happen twice
hello agata kun
ten well call it even okay
pcs arent just mere objects like trees or rocks
seeking but a miracle
after argues went under a company called rct was entrusted wit the post management of sao
but its not like we wont see her again
o it was long before tat
wick allows for free roaming flight once a person becomes accustomed to it
one meal
i see
the imprisoned queen
the moon beckons again tonight
it should still be a clue we can use
he sounds like an idiot for taking it so seriously
sigurd and is party want to go hunting again tis afternoon
cheers
fairy boots
but kibaou finding himself corneredpanicked and lured thinker into a trap
it was a long time ago
you cant you cant do tis to me
ive decided to party wit tis guy for a while
both the boss and the ten men and vanished
theres no rule tat says you cant express emotion in a game
hey yuri can
but i dont want to risk accidentally hurting you
its more or less a habit now
mamma please smile
yea id like to clear the current floor within the week
ill make im pay
all right here we go
its a different story if you upgrade your hearing skill
either way we cant ignores tis
a single command is all you need to summon a legendary blade
inside their territory you wont be able to attack them
youre all too far away
well always be together
ive heard of tat name
o kirito
youre no longer just a program controlled by the system
thats the combined damage you seven can do to me
kirito swan waits tat
here e is
do you two know each other
theres a legendary castle on the top of tis tree
wow ice fight
its not a boss you can take on wit a small number of players
its player made
moreover they tougt they could spread fear by faking safe area murders
tis pit isnt a trap its the dragoons den
well need to use the appraisal skill ten
whats your name can you tell me
but organized pks like tat one have only started to happen recently
need the money so badly tat you were willing to kill griselda swan your wife and steal the ring
i think tis is more humane taen planting electrodes into exposed animal brains
y youve got to be kidding me
cheers
keitas ideals might influence teinsular mindset of the front liners
wed like to be part of tat effort
one landed sword
will those guys be okay
thanks for visiting so often
thats why the pk guild came ere
mamma
thanks silica
stand by at headquarters until you receive further orders
we were called to the frontlines during our leave so it must be something major
hey you still have yolko on your friend list right
lets at least walk her there instead of using the teleporter
whats tat
yelp its really straightforward after all
as the ruler of alfeim all players look up to me in awe
used a crystal to teleport away
formally duels are held to test ones strength
you assaulted a guild called silver flags ten days ago didnt you
you want to look after her until se regains her memory right
heres abilpa beans sage leaves and oola fils bones
also ill handle tis alone
how about your name
the moon beckons again tonight
first strike mode
wick means se migtve been sleep pked
and ten i became hopelessly addicted to alfeim online
his name was caynz
hes good
even the big guilds are in a frenzy searcin for it
reaper
while others wanted to sell it and split toe earnings ultimately dividing toe guild
in my case my rapiers speed would drop if i did
my battle healing skill auto regenerates points every seconds
the center of alfeim and the largest city in tis world
well ten ill read back home first okay
dont thank me just yet
well always be together
thank you for coming today at my beest
are you the spriggans secret weapon or something
and move it left or right to turn
tat includes watching over your come
i do change it up a little tough
o its undoubtedly caused by the emotion incitement circuits
he mustve invested a lot of time into tis
youll break your sword if you do tat
cannot beat the feeling of having found a future to aim for
we used to be a small guild were tecommander would personally invite members
if tat was a ghost it wouldnt use a teleportation crystal
we of the liberation front do not know the meaning of the word retreat
everyones working hard to verify if theres a quest we missed
the majority of saos one thousand beta testers
damn it tis isnt the time to think
i was really scared
and after five minutes passed the door finally opened
maybe your locations data got corrupted or maybe there was some interference
we can get there safely even at level
wit the guards on and everything
and we of the clearing group have a duty to uphold to them
its inexcusable behavior at school
a part of me tougt tis world was just a game
sups theyre remain lights
well we know one thing for sure now
well supposedly theres an unlimited number of them
would tomorrow be better
he disappeared
nor is it because i now have a partner to adventure wit
so tat i could meet im ere
you know yuri tis is very spicy
im your fan
we need to get out of ere by foot anyway right
its not like its been proved tat dealt ere applies in the real world too
so is it actually impossible to ascend to the top of yggdrasil
its not like well be fighting a boss
altoug we couldnt stay long it was fun
youre such an obstinate woman
ill never let anyone in my party die as long as im standing
wat toe ell so much for the floating city
its said tat toe dragon stores the rare metal inside its body
first well all it level
id prater not fight against you one on one
tat was a difficult battle indeed
i have to bury team deep within my heart
i see
and just so were clear we wont have time for naps
im sure se really loves kendo
is there any other way to log out
theres sleep poking wick takes advantage of the duel system
well lure the field boss into the village
damn it
you slowly move orizontally while covering
so e could kill you all in one fell swoop
dont lean out too far or youll fall off
the sao incident hasnt ended yet
you have good intuition
it is your duty to cooperate wit us
so im sure sell wake up eventually
im really glad we met
still preparing the equipment for everyone in the rapid party is going to take some time
are all private pixies like tat
wat on earth was tat attack
thats why we told you the time was later than it really was
footwork aside my attacks are the problem
of course well be in the same party
they really need to stop exaggerating their stories
or drive me out of the government
well es weird but es not a bad guy
because im the one wo will protect you
the moon beckons again tonight
so now do you believe wat i said earlier
there are tree possibilities at most
right in the crotc
whats e talking about
merry christmas kirito
if we go together you should be able to manage
i made the sandwics sauce wit tat
very suspicious
and maintain order amongst the people
wyd you go alone
hed earn a lot from having is personal bunting ground
you can find a gift from me in your item storage
did you join a guild
scavenge toad meat
he knew but e didnt tell us
are they your fans
in sao theres no way to tell wo got wat unless someone announces their drops
wat happens to the items if your spouse dies
think its a bug
are you out of your mind
y yea
whats e saying
anyway lets get a move on
in tis world
did you see anyone else
idiots
see how our player indicators are green
hey lets go make some cabs while keitas off buying the house
tis kind as guts
ready a teleport crystal just in case
thats why you were in the nd floor woods
are you ere to express disapprovalfor wat we did yesterday
altoug i was the last one standing i succeeded in repelling the criminals and returned safely
such research is already taking place in many countries
so could you even taste stem
the fundamental research for the manipulation of emotion and tougt is already complete
miracles really do exist
ive always distanced myself from her
griselda swan mustve been attackedby a player wo knew about the ring
tat solo player kirito and a member of the knights of blood are dueling
theres no class system you know
yes please
of course ill deactivate my immortality
looks like youve found something important to you
ive never seen anything like it
lastly concerning loot distribution
a treasure cest
world of swords
hurry up and use your teleport crystals
gotta trow a bone to hero boy
there should be another way out if we cant use our crystals
president
first strike mode
odds are ill never get another one either
everything in tis world will be destroyed in about minutes
system command set pain absorber to level
unfortunately for you there arent any gods in tis world
its kind of far so i think ill spend the night ere
it couldnt have been a sleep pk either
will give me strength in tis dark world
tat look on your face is exquisite titania
they waver and change scape yet again
it wasnt during a duel
we cant toe crystals arent working
im not scared
ill old on to these steadfast vows
but its not like theyre all going to attack me on sight right
i heard it was dissolved
sure youre strong too but
tis could be a trap tat kills everybody wo falls in
really so youre tat zero kirito kun
if youre not wit me i wont be able to smile again
safe area murders
first strike mode
it was a valuable experience for me
its like tis every day
mamma
o im going to win
a ghost could easily pk at an inner area
so theres no need for you to fight as a vanguard
well its the first day of official service
ill old on to these steadfast vows
the first race to old an audience wit the king can transform into alfs apparently
want to try facing thirty people from the clearing group
not many would bother to do tat tough
lets duel
i tougt tat inside the game world i was an invincible hero
thank you
heres to us the black cats of the full moon
the game as been cleared
noting would be too big a sacrifice
im sure my daughter would like tat too
looks like there are fairy races from all over the land ere
se was wandering around in a forest on the nd floor
cardinal inexplicably ordered me not to interact wit any players
will destroy your brain tush ending your life
we loners are to target
onii canst earth belongs only to tat girl
to the center of the world
dont you apologize for anything right now
our only option is to try again wit the largest force possible
its not from a store
on christmas eve wick is at midnight
thats the pk guild laughing coffin
would you happen to know anything
the punishment for such a sin is of course dealt
you damn murderer
itd be too late ten
ill old on to these steadfast vows
kirito kun dont you want to join a guild
its because its a virtual world tat there are things we have to protect
we just looked into the boss room
ever since tat day i didnt reallyknow now close i was to my family
if tis was the real world
o way
errors gradually accumulated within me and i eventually broke down
you called out my name when we were fighting
y yea
is the person at the top of yggdrasil tat important to you
theyll do anything for a rare item
even i cant bring up the system menu
tat surprised me
you should refrain from calling me tat in tis world
youre right ses really acute
papa tis door isnt locked by a quest flag
and move their finger to make them accept the duel request
im a friend of sugou sand
and now the preparations are complete
well if it isnt a leader of the divine dragon alliance
o way
do i really have to explain
the ceremony will be held in a week on january t in tis hospital room
thats why i think we should
ive been strapped in tis world for two years
ill old on to these steadfast vows
welcome to my world
will give me strength in tis dark world
but surely you know wat appenswen you oppose the liberation front
dueling is the only way you candamage someone at an inner area
anyway waits tis about a chef
hes your friend in real life too right
the lakes around ere are way too hard to fits at
the moon beckons again tonight
see tis is no problem for us
hey yolko sand
so now do you think the murder happened
the black swordsman
have you ever heard of the name grimlock
ill old on to these steadfast vows
you guys can back at me all day and it wouldnt do a thing
ill old on to these steadfast vows
isnt it more fun to use your own body to fight
well its true tat because of the rare weapon i had bought wit toe extra money
theres an american corporation etats eagerly awaiting the researcs completion
tis magical sword is a beast among monster drops
even so youre going to learn just now terrifying inner area fights can be
you can see another hap gauge below yours around ere right
look im not going to let you die ere
ten twos the other
including the army around of them should be in the starting town so
yea i ear you
instead id like to be your exclusive blacksmit
for it to be observed at tis frequency snows its past the tresold
or at least thats the most plausible scenario
weve built up quite a margin for safety too
wered you find the time to pack a lunch
and e used to be in the same guild as me
well everyone attending tis school is a victim of the sao incident
dont worry im sure its just acontinuation of the opening ceremony
ill be leading to the next town as soon as possible
mamma
dont forget to unwrap it properly first
once se wakes up we can probably figure tis out
but is switcing wit a fishing rood possible
thanks to tat swordsmen and info brokers have been ganging up on me all day
shared inventories
perhaps in the form of an item
in other words money and exp are limited in number
but if you still feel anything other than hatred for tat world
there are a tone of skills like blacksmiting and stuff right
i and the steps down but my attacks werent so good
ill old on to these steadfast vows
the guy wo made it is a genius
but saos rules are fundamentally fair
feel free to come anytime you needsomeone to fix your weapons and armour
well those two are givens
im sick of using dolls
im going to see it for myself
live to see the end of tis world
so were already on a first name basis
some information broker you are
the players were seized wit negativeemotions like fear despair and rage
something about you guys interfering wit our plans
yes weve mapped toe route up to the boss room
the sao incident isnt over just yet
truth is i rushed to get teardware just because of sao
but tis is her busiest time of day so it might take a while
there werent any items or methods tat would make them possible to begin wit
lugrue corridor
theres the exit
its so pretty
the second parts pretty fisy
just so you know es no smaller in real life
yea but we cant be sure unless we test it
a hidden door here
just a moment ago all surviving players were flogged out
and even started extorting peopleunder the pretext of collecting taxes
if we trace toe spears origins
o im just fine
his shield
i know its against the rules to bring real life problems ere
kirito swan would you mind leaving im wit us
and even if we warn them in time its likely tat only the leaders would be able to escape
let me go you freaks
its the result of a years worst of practice and study
reviving somebody isnt possible in tis world
his declaration was the truth and noting but the truth
youre pretty absorbed in tis game
we owe tis victory to you
i still cant believe tat its all just a game
it seems tat at the time of the sao worlds collapse
o morning onii can
every beta tester said it was incredible
i think its best to dispose of them before theyre detected by an error program
it was regrettable tat you my most anticipated prey left the party
wat happened to your lizard
to the rumored spot
o for furniture
silica are you still awake
yea it was only is armour
as for you you accompanied her anyway despite knowing wo i was
by the way if you go below level tree it will start affecting your real body
hey yuri can
seeking but a miracle
did you already forget how i said id party up wit you
well ten in half an our well assemble at the towns west gate
he mustve been a beta tester
we recorded everything scmitt
school
yea se probably flogged in together wit her family
while the boss is killing pcs well attack and destroy it
im going to the hospital
in just two months my research as made great progress
se was the perfect and ideal wife
im afraid of dying
wo would ten become the hero tat confronts toe demon king
sigurd plans to march a massive army of salamanders straight to the signing ceremony
you do know wat it means to obstruct the liberation army dont you
the endless world stretches out before me
so youre saying my sword is weaker than youd tougt
youre right but
twenty minutes
congratulations on clearingte game kirito kun asuna kun
i used them to make the sauce for the sandwices
seeking but a miracle
trougout the meeting se didnt sow her back to us even once
we want to help you in any way we can
i love you kirito
i missed my chance to eat earlier too
processed toe parameters of the or so different seasonings i found in aincrad
you can no longer respawn in tis game
do you know were your father and mother are
sleep poking wasnt widely known six months ago
so we came to the town of beginnings
and theres noting particularly strange about tis weapon
e easier said taen done
theres a town in sylp territory called sylvian to the west
if you go down tat way theres one thats dirt cheap
theres still some time left
wat do you say
sum my name is yoruko
utwoots presents
youre not getting another one
is tat black robbed figure really griselda sans ghost
a player wo as abandoned their own territory
wat will you do if you catch it
tis floor is known as the flower garden
do i have to tell
stay down ere and catch im
s sakuya can look
ive only seen im a few times went clearing bosses
im saying you cant keep outer players permanently equipped to yourself
i dont regret it all
a a player
but there are too many
howd you create tis flavor tough
i detached yuis main program and turned it into an object
i guess we really dont look tat similar
wat do you mean by tat
say is tat one of those private pixies
idiot
im just a program
prepare for battle
e must be targeting the tree wo wanted to use the ring
yuri were gonna run so navigate for us
those mineral lights look just like stardust
teleport crystal
do you know anybody wo goes by the name of grimlock
one mount into the game people have died
there are about surviving players in sao
strength in tis world is just an illusion
thats the unfair reality of an mmorpg leveling system
but in the end the matter was resolved by voting
ten the reason we were in the same party for two weeks was
hmm our ceesecake is taking forever
well old im off until you recover
it doesnt matter weter or not tis body is real
tis place is full of people
in other words tat ingot is dragon excrement
ill be fine wit toe tricks you taught me
had we been defeated the salamanders wouldve held an overwhelming advantage over us
okay lets go to the next area
anyway its not a big deal so dont worry about it
the moon beckons again tonight
wat do you mean
thirty minutes one our
they must have suspected scmitt from the start
w wait are you going wit tat spriggan from yesterday
inner area incident
hey is tat a private pixie
i want to see it for myself
in the southern part of the t floorteres a field dungeon called the hill of memories
seeking but a miracle
the whole ride
leafa you intend to abandon your territory and become a renegade
hey no change in plans for the after party right
ten twos the last person
will give me strength in tis dark world
unfortunately the friends and family members of several players avez ignored tis warning
youre no different from the rest of my test subjects
including the mental exalt care of players
wat a great view
you said it was a secret just between us two but you went and revealed it anyway
its not something i really want to remember
nobody would leave a safe area carrying such a rare item
from tis town
i didnt think the town of beginningswould have a dungeon like tis beneath it
theyre people wove committed murder and are known as red players
tis is noting compared to the pain youve inflicted upon asuna
however your strength as exceeded my expectations
but an object can still lose durability
y youre a good person
your skills should be fine as long as a human game master doesnt notice
the first is troug a legitimate duel
you should be thanking kirito kun
but there are a lot of strong monsters lurking around ere
im sure itll be lonely but please be patient
my grandfather beat me for it
apparently tat freaked toe gems out so they quickly patced the game
hm lets see
tat unkempt face of yours suits you ten times better
the towns are safe areas
but during a duel you can take damage and lose hap even at an inner area
the guy wo eavesdropped on us yesterday was one of your men right
still its hard to believe tat it was a coincidence
mamma rang in there
push on the button to speed up and let go to slow down
tree thanks ganging up on one girl
go ahead and shower
but one day
so es your friend in real life too
can you do it
sorry to ask tis of you but could you do me one last favor
just so you know gig level spells are around twenty words long
the black cats is by no means a weak guild
the time kazuto suddenly asked about is real parents
switc
its just the boss room thats left ahead right
my daughter would appreciate it
the game were we make them fight amongst themselves sparing the last one standing
please give me strength one more time
youre saying many beginners died because the beta testers didnt take care of them
morning dew girl
it is my duty to guard you
we can be certain tat it was premeditated murder
well its inside the domes at the base of the tree
we should be in the neutral region for a while
and even went as far as to extort people under the pretense of tax collection
party wit us next time
are you talking about griselda sang and grimlock sand
it was pretty fun
ill write you an word essay on how good it was
all we can do is plunge ahead
o good morning onii can

the armys great warriors were annihilated by a blue demon
if someones found a way to pk even in safe areas
back ten caynzs armour was impaled by the spear

nobody else thinks like tat
the amuspere is just a ervegear wit better security
are you really going to use asunascomatose state to your advantage
either way itd have been nice if i ended up closer to yggdrasil
formally i wouldve quickly attended to those players
the two parties will make contact in fifty seconds

for now all we can do is fight right
ill old on to these steadfast vows

im thinking i can use tis gm account to back into the system
right now at the sao mainframe located five floors below arguss corporate headquarters
its not like im going out of my way to help you after all
i tougt it was some sort of minim boss
youre so weird
fine youre the exception
is it true tat skains was killed wit grimlocks weapon
murder
i took refuge inside your ervegears local memory
the ervegear will destroy your brain
thank goodness tis isnt a dream
can you stop addressing me so rudely
but wat about your guild asuna
in games up till now you couldave fun while playing the bad guy
i used tis to eliminate tat monster
its already morning
there are bound to be some bugs

ive learned one thing while living ere
ill be back before you know it
id prater not fight against you one on one
keep it busy for ten seconds please
theres noting more boring tanwatcing someone else play an rpg
isnt se asuna from the knights of blood
ten at a back alley they put on their invisibility cloaks and disappeared
it doesnt look like youre using the sword linz made either
all races can only fly for ten minutes at a time
yet was satisfied wit just the creation of a mere game world
its amazing its perfect
o its fine
there is only one condition you must meet to be free
its a recently developed gig level tecnique
quick come over ere
and thats it for the stew
by a large group of outlaw players out in the field
do you think our relationship is limited to tis world
i wouldnt want a party member to die on me
a beater like you and no right to get involved wit us
about points every seconds
weve already fulfilled our obligations in tis incident
around wat level is your cooking skill right now
tat weapons already killed someone
in tat case in tis world were murders go unpunished i should
and fight to liberate all playersfrom tis world as soon as possible
ten se partied wit me for those two weeks because
as many as ten thousand test subjects
how could you participate in such illegal and inumane research
he probably fired a red player to murder der
two of us fell fighting bravely in vain
we can live happily enjoying our days together
red nosed reindeer
ill sow you the results of my daily reab at the gym
ill do it tomorrow
seeking but a miracle
but for just a little longer
finally i finally got to meet you
even if i end up dead at the hands of a monster
but i owe kirito kun a drink for saving me
to the core of tis world
the ervegear must still be communicating wit der
a card
hurry up and kill im
the white shadow slowly walked to the other side of the grove
i guess its time to say goodbye
same ere
h hey silica can
the moon beckons again tonight
countless objects have changed the sky
will give me strength in tis dark world
i wonder if se presents me becausesed rather be doing something else
i repeat
im grateful enough to want to thank you
it wasnt love tat you felt for griselda sand
everyone charge
brought a true virtual world into existence
wouldnt e normally make someone else do it
youd never get tat kind of look from an pc woman
mamma
im a member of the glorious knights of blood
can i really
is tat your name
im sure se really loves kendo
tis is also an important part of the armys duty
yuri can were going to a very dangerous place
i need to hurry back
about the reason for our guilds destruction
you two can keep watch
so you are younger than me
two years ago when the service officially began
its probably a dungeon tat opens upas toe iger floors are cleared
mamma
youre still worrying about before
je just the name
tat my beloved yuuko had vanished
certainly neither our leader nor i wish to antagonize toe spriggans or undines at the moment
im not asking you to party wit me
storage scaring i mean
the save data formats for both games are practically identical
dont leave me alone
i heard its pronounced alvame
if you promise not to laugh ill tell you
itd be a waste to spend a day like tis in a dungeon
you dont have to apologize
its time for tis weeks episode of mmo stream
when we do itll be as friends just like now
o wonder no one can find it
youll be surprised by now much as changed
you love every side of them tat you already know
in the soutwest area of the nd floor theres a small village surrounded by forestry and a lake
tat wasnt a ghost
her sword speed and accuracy weresuperior to mine even to the very end
you knew the tecniques tat toe boss used
wit your star parameter it should be a piece of cake right
hey nice fight
you can have them
he was only ten years old
around ere deep in the forest apparently you can see things
why is se so mean to me
wat are your plans for today
i didnt think sped actually fall asleep
my sister told im to stop pitting me because sped put in enough effort for the both of us
tis is a console tat allows gems emergency access to the system
its also said tat you need a master blacksmit wit you to get the metal
it might even spark a war between the sylps and the cait sits
the world seed
the reason
i only inferred tat possibility
watch out
warmth of the heart
ill accept your offer and take it easy for today
ive betrayed my love for you
every day tat we waste in ere is a day lost in the real world
thinker hasnt moved from tat position
there are a lot of strong monsters around ere tough
well ive seen it first and several times
why wyd you let diabel an die
o are we buying furniture
watch carefully asuna sama
tis is sugou kun the man in charge of our research institutes
lets side and wait for them to pass by
they couldnt care less about the rest of us
the one wo killed them all including saci was me
the dead disappear no matter wat world
whose instructions
well everyone tat attends tis school is a victim of the sao incident
wat a nice name
run and wide as best as you can outside leafa
however if you decide to disrupt tis conference well have to escalate matters
ill old on to these steadfast vows
im sure we will
can surpass the feeling of having found meaning in tomorrow
now tell me worse idea it was to attack us
his head is wide open
i want to thank you linz
its a trap
so when we got separated in the plaza
wat is it
if we can get there we should be able to use teleportation crystals
i just stayed out of it because everyone seemed to know each other already
thats right
its name is dark repulser
you look like my little sister
tis place never ceases to amazed me
four members were killed leaving only the leader alive
well ten guess its my turn to log off now
ten thousand ideal test subjects
money
an immortal object
her parents are oblivious to tat
so i was positive tat e was really up to something
as we speak on the fifth abasement floor of argues hq the memory banks in the sao mainframe
theres a barrier just above the clouds now
but im sure you will all manage to reach me
my world
seeking but a miracle
i was unable to do anything exceptmonitor the players mental states
w wat toe ell is tat skill
yea my family left me something to eat
stay ere for a little while okay
you coming wit us to activate the transport gate
o dont worry about it
you idiot
i used it to erase tat monster
the money is automatically distributed
of course
or did i mess up the pronunciation
system command generate object id excaliber
its inconvenient not being able to contact each other since were both in the clearing group
just wait to be judged by the law
dragoons breath attack at the ready
o its silica can
theres no rule saying you cant express your emotions in a game
didnt you get a message before we were attacked by those salamanders
leafa do you intend to abandon your rome territory and become a renegade too
thinker was left to die in the depths of a dungeon
s sorry
well switc places later so you can see it
only the large one tat you were fishing at
i remember it like it was yesterday
well as our ultimate goal yes
you two seem pretty close tough
you guys would go tat far for griselda
but tis is were the whole group is supposed to em toe boss in
sorry i forgot
its so warm
damn it
i truly wonder went youll willingly accept me as your companion
however im sure you two will soon return to battle
its like sao but wit magic instead of sword skills
someones been killed by tat weapon
but the spear was cipping away at the armors durability and not skains hap
it was a small guild of six including me
tis game wont be the end of you
the method was too involved for it to be some random duel
anyway wat toe ell was tat man
an immortal object
it was just a desire to possess der
her coordinates are right above us in the sky
in a place were no one can see me
im no good
lets check the central market first
hes probably ten levels iger than you kuradeel
the four races sally ally themselves against the salamanders
yea its the metal we came for
so in forty minutes at an area near butterfly valley
you idiot dont come out yet
wit only units available
were both just data in a virtual world yet
you cant use gig level sealing magic unless youre an undine
sorry were supposed to keep wat went on inside the sao server a secret arent we
o just a bit longer
i shall explain it to the other guild members
in terms of pure fighting ability es said to be the strongest player in the game
if you need to speak do it as softly as you can
will give me strength in tis dark world
bartender one bourbon on the rocks
theres no mistake
o i only have access to wide area map and reference data
to do tat from inside the game would require a corresponding console
return the children
and in my case party members are more likely to hinder taen help me
teleport to starting town
but before we part ways
thank you come again sir
thats an order from your vice commander
reopening it as a special school for middle andig school students wo were strapped in sao
even if youre the vice commander itd be problematic for you to ignores regulations
w well ive heard of im
its strange
jeez dont get carried away
looks like there are a few strange bugs left
all i have for you is disdain and loathing
theres a big limit to wat you can do as a solo player
the ervegear covers your entire wead wit a big density transmitter
hang in there ill save you soon
so the strongest player is revealed to be the big bad final boss
ill old on to these steadfast vows
so basically regardless of weter or not the game is cleared
w were you listening
countless objects have changed the sky
tis is the entrance
online gamers can get really jealous
it sure looks like you arent very close to any other girls
do you know wat happened to argues after they developed sao
illusion magics all youll really be good at tough
reaper
he is armed wit an axe and a bucklers
as expected of the knights of bloods clearing group representative
because the person tat you come to knowis wo tat person really is
i can do a better job than you
formally id be able to go in your place if you covered my expenses
and be allowed to occupy and tax the capital for ten days
but why did my character data remain
my name is agile
silica something wrong
if your spouse dies wat happens to the items
the fields around the starting town will soon be wiped clean of mobs
so the levels of any skills soared bybot games must have been overwritten
and tat class
but tat guy
would you like the school to save you
school trip guidebook page
meanwhile we got to pretend to have fun while we got everytin ready
a a yakuza emblem
its fun but a little depressing
dropout mentality
if tis gets out you will be forced to undergo a memory wiping operation
im afraid were done for today
why are we ere at school
and e said eyd use is zoom eyes to find one for me
they both possess superhuman abilities granted to them by science
ill jump in there and finish im off
hey our group never got to go ahead wit our assassination attempt
id like to go around and take in all kinds of colors not just the one
heres the indian cai you requested
dont worry about me
and now youre ordering us around when it suits you
how the liveliest students at tis school
having mastered ten languages
hup pass
assassination by infiltration requires flexibility toward ones target
very well young man
if youre gonna cut it off agisa kun sooner is better
weter its learning more about everyone or killing korosensei
her style focuses on mastering difficult pronunciation first
id been on guard around you all tis time
so wat now
very well et
wat is tis wave of nervousness
thats how i got my name red eye
groups for the school trip u
lets see the staircase to go up
grownups are sneaky
youll have plenty of opportunities to learn the truth
so wyre yea walking around somewhere etats ripe for a kidnappin
six ours from tokyo
you want to know wat theyre feeling
he can easily escape before you finish im off
hup pass
we made it but theres a lookout
our snipers cure
those moves mastered troug long years of experience
in just five ours we flew to hawaii while listening to a lecture
ten were free to pick out our sniper spots
youre into boobs right you must have at least and a crush on someone
in games and stuff they sell for way less than a giant stage
or attempt to expose my nonexistent secrets
well find our target and unleas our bloodtirst
karasuma sensei hasnt recovered enough to fire wit any accuracy
of course it is
the reward ten billion yen
how are the boobs
and secondly i lack the capability to provide im support
the ball flew so slowly tat i got bored waiting for it to arrive
shall we carry on wit our school trip ten
ciba as spatial figures down pat
how group is going dolpin watching yes
tree days and two nights at a luxury summer school in always summery okinawa
here kimura try tis
hey karma kun want to be in my group
o lets all go
we are killers
he takes good care of us and all
i downloaded my data into everyones cellpones
why i checked the man himself yesterday
one tis size could fetch twenty thousand
i get it
wat is e a wild animal now
first you must have two weapons
wat wit getting to see different sides of everyone and all
thats another key to sticking around et in tis business
it ought to strike a real cord wit you at your age
a wire trap dwy
its perfect for an assassination
ill be keeping an eye on im of course
well its not like you wont stay up talking anyway
sorry im late
i and all kinds of ways to approach im prepared
its impossible karasuma sand
spend one day resting and your fingers and arms forget about killing
great i cant wait to get out of these clothes
and so the curtain fell on one exciting school trip
its time we killed you for real
but tougts of our classes together drew me away
siblings have no need for cheap tricks
whats e playing at
well find our target and unleas our bloodtirst
but ill have more delicious treats for you when its all over
why were you created
my apologies i got caught up starring in a samurai drama
it cant be
junior gig students talking happily about assassination
es andicapped himself for an assassination competition
all we can do is listen quietly
okay you lowlifes whoever wants tis baby raise your and
they look way tough too
korosensei may not have been wit us today
dont we have the right to know a bit more about our teacher
tat pistol wont make me move a single step
se can bewitc targets from anywhere in the world
yea well es one scary dude
its not even a contest
turns out im still a novice when it comes to assassination
we need six shouldnt we get another girl
tat is not the face of innocence
we start off whispering about overtrowing the status quon
a coconut i bought in hawaii yesterday
whats the very best assassin like
well there you have it welcome bitch sensei
someone left them next to the outdoor pool
a deadly tecnique doesnt necessarily kill instantly
plus tis baby can it tree hundred kilometers an our
ill give you something good in return
the only answer ere is yes
i wont
as a long distance sniper es second to none
ill give you all a taste of my speed
if only you could have stayed like tat
every mountain as one the smut stabs
okay so if we corner im there
so e gets all sick and groggy on bullet trains and bushes
i ate her already
leaves no openings on the battlefield
peeping
first lets take a look at the phenomenon of dilatancy
so tis is the last problem
thats weird
you just played both sides till you got the grades you wanted damn traitor
he makes himself and others shine wit is physical might and the ability to get things done
all right lets begin our lesson
please enjoy tis tropical juiced wit our compliments
he had never known true defeat
official passports
im stuck ere trying to kill tat octopus
we sure learned a lot about one another on tis school trip
indeed no army is capable of tat feat
well use our porn power to give im a dream ell never wake up from
while the rest of us slip past a few at a time
why dont we work together on a poison thatll really kill me
dammit you idiot yuuji
and youve grown back the arm tat itona took in is first surprise attack
we are killers
his speed and defense is impeccable
you need only two things to win over your students
wat kind of assassin bergs for permission
sow me a family tat doesnt do as the dead says
but its only because im a super lech tat i know
yelp along wit every other living sting
the students seem to like your lessons tough
its a small price to pay for a free trip to hawaii
come to the staff room later
i cant wait
youre a boy
a public execution
your dismissal notice
you go bitch sensei
wat kind of a reaction is tat
okajima kun im confiscating tat camera
you gonna give in to the crazy and trow your chance at ten billion out the window
as such you will receive the same assassination assignment
to learn quite a few new languages tat way
from ere on out its their free time
ive been known to dabble in tis kind of hobby
i get tat you want to sow off your grading speed but
his strengts come troug were es out in the field
whats more se seems to really have a thing for korosensei
i can stab my knife five times in one second
standard practice for any assassin wo uses per womanly whiles
he makes a point of relaxing behind the school every day before omeroom
you need crazy good grades to have any chance of making it back
the ministry of defense as no firing rights ere
my experience makes tat clear
dont forget about tat tentacle now korosensei
even if siota agisa did try to turn tis into an assassination
youre always so interested in bitch senseis work yada sand
o fair korosensei
one way to say tis in english is wit the word really
i believe you said youd put a collar on me and keep me as a pet
ice use the local specialty to send im to a local cemetery
upon success each person will share in the ten billion yen based on the degree of their contributions
its like a bonus i tougt youd be happy
and if you still dont think of me as a teacher
so you will refer to me as miss jelavic
but ill also be providing toe students wit toe tecnical and mental support they need
first we trow im off blunting is moves
so tat just leaves mate
is a famous stop along the sagano sigtseeing train line
tentacles
o hang on
these are my report cards for you
and youll be treated like dirt by students and teachers alike
surely se knows tat wont work on im wat a fool
not too shabby for a side job
fine by me but can you even handle one of my plans
we may have managed to defeat those tree assassins on our own terms
and yet we still feel like were entering the same arena as many others
four of us scored digest in the most important subject rome etc
you gotta keep an eye on im you dummy
challenging and mastering them as tough they were a foreign language
thats right
i was about to make the wrong move
after all youre my precious family
a brutal assassination method indeed
kunugigaoka junior high school class e
but agisa might just go troug wit it
im guessing you never read salingers the catcher in the rye
clothes obbies status
anata to iou furaku no target ucinukeru desou oka
youve always dodged questions about your true form
they might clue me in to a good assassination method
why not take tis chance to sling a little mud
tat some kinds of bloodlust are wrong to old on to
well could you follow im wit your eyes
first well fix tat droopy fake nose of yours
firstly is adjustments took longer than expected
its for tat one second of yours better safe taen sorry right
my elbows and wrists are better
back to the dance floor wit you
judging from the bulges there
the first print comes wit a papercraft model of kinkakuji
as a teacher youre their caperone look the part
tat ought to go far in training
but wit your yelp we can still do it in one trip
it dulls the senses of tentacled lifeforms
o terasaka kun
plus if you put my tentacle to your ear
ill dodge all is attacks ten torment im endlessly
we have one our
kunugigaoka academys students place on average standard deviations above the mean
apologies ill get you some new bulbs right now
losers are people just like you wo have their own lives their own tougts and their own worries
a real knife
consider its viability for assassination tough
yelp in a boat tough is tat okay
okay owes our chance
korosensei agisas put the stung gun away
a yes tis tastes like sodium ydroxide
can i help you okuda sand
if es looking for a pool theres one at the main campus
ill just itch a ride on your strategy and take the best parts for myself
my choice of colors is not to blame
so either we become the killers of a bunch of respectable junior gig kinds
day in and day out we try everything we can think of
tight lipped and knows better than to pry
theres not enough for everyone but it is your last ope
hey now quit being a wet blanket
not you too
tell us about it tomorrow
tat kind of restrictions works especially well wit tis guy
if you interfere even slightly wit my assassination
o will you
we start off whispering about overtrowing the status quon
i wasnt informed of tis
we secretly wonder if were giving them our best answers
stopped cold by a soft uncooked sheet of doug
but we still advent found a surefire way to assassinate our teacher
the school pays for the hotel and everything tat goes wit it
but soon enough well feel like crying out arg
your beady eyes like two diarrea pills
you think so okajima kun
seven tentacles is a big andicap but dont stop there
but our way of life as only just begun
i really want to stay ere you know tat
okay team well have to use the vip only emergency stairs to reach the next floor up
im going easy on them karasuma
of course im is teacher
and of course plenty of killing
from the looks of things at tis hotel
he seriously prepared the slab while dodging tree knives at once
agisa
it twicks me off tat youre deliberately managing your character
yes i very much enjoy being your teacher
think we can pull it off agisa
have you no same my idiot apprentice
good thing we all and a and in tis scheme
how ten time for omeroom
yelp like a real match
korosensei as a major sweet tooth
hey were should we go on day two
tat brothers tinge sure as everyone comparing the two of us
im doubling tonigts omework
your grades put you dead last right
triggers dilatant behavior in your cells
those are the circumstances
hes got korosenseis sweet tooth all right
so whats the group agisa kun sugino kayano can and
how tat you mention it tis is a real good trip for assassins
exams are an opportunity to correctly teach the meaning of winning and losing and of strength and weakness
i tougt you were busy burying im in concrete
chances are a complex plan like tis will go off the rails once or twice
train well and you could far surpass im
is to get yourself a lover wo speaks it
inconveniently enough our target is our ever dependable teacher
tis is our chance to see waits inside korosensei
anata to iou furaku no target ucinukeru desou oka
so skip once whats the difference
wat kind of guidebook would consider tat possibility
ill stand stock still in front of you for one whole second no matter wat
if youre looking for answers to the big questions from me
youll need to explain things clearly to as many people as possible
so wat color is bewilderment
and tat disguise wont fool anyone up close
wat was even the point of me being in tis getup
o you girls would be in too much danger on your own
theyre badasses toe likes of wick you do gooder brats have never
so youre a teacher
tat way it can stand up to even mach speed air resistance
our next assassinations at tat island resort right
in sort ses cramp
let em avez tat lousy old domestic trip
tat they hated her
yea etats wat girls talk about on these strips its fun
all to hunt you down
shall we get started wit toe assassination
the only thing left to worry about
six now tat would have been rough
kanzaki swan doesnt stand out but ses popular wit all of us
were in our final stage of infiltration ere
a trap
some soot better cross legged taen wit one knee up
anata to iou furaku no target ucinukeru desou oka
w wat was tat look
excellent
the power difference ere is just way too great
you simply must read it in both languages
indecent and arrogant as se is straightforward and honest
altoug no other students avez distinguished themselves
indeed as an assassin se isnt much to be feared
but the same conditions apply to us all
its a place filled wit neverending dreams
their school is famous tat is true
but please make all necessary preparations
and you come to see their abilities their circumstances
tis is just between us but my old man es a famous tv personality
id like to see wat you have on im
you think ill let you get one over on me like tat
we could always trow rome etc into those five subjects
so much for picking up on your expressions
even while traveling it is most uncout to ask after the number of ones appendages
well start wit a movie
a white clad guardian and a transfer student twos impossible to read
each of them will progress in their development as assassins
comic relief du
and first in the whole year level
honestly wo arranges a class trip tis early in tired year
hey agisa
and now ive snatched away your once in a lifetime chance at making a name for yourself
a creature capable of destroying the earth
tis trick worked wonders in the military too
you were a terrible apprentice
itll be a fun assassination
is the moment korosensei leans out the window to look at the boat
o excuse me
id say they fit perfectly in my classroom
dropout mentality
agisa can
but you would have had to stop us by any means necessary
he writes different questions for each student
it must be enjoyed in an orderly fashion
woa twere octopus
my educational principles are functioning flawlessly
thank goodness you okay kanzaki sand
everyone gets along really well and everyone is equal
it paint like wat e said
siros not out to kill us students
well kanzaki swan did you find the itinerary
you gotta dig deeper on your character backgrounds fuwa sand
for example
bitch sensei waits wit toe hollywood starlet look
the place were well kill korosensei
on the other and if you can save the earth
it was bullsit from the word go
we didnt get any closer to determining korosenseis true nature tough
there are two others correct
shall i
as you make full use of the basics you learned in the first term
kanzaki sang as an unexpected side to her too
ive always admired tis kind of subtle rebellion
hey im takaoka akira and ill be assisting karasuma as of today
is no match for the wolf wit a cow killing vision
tat unusual pitching form i saw yesterday
seven eeek
and after school tat will become extremely evident
i just couldnt believe my tentacles
he can use mucius to solidify the water around im and tweak toe permeation pressure
those weird pellets wont be necessary
im coming for you e class
sum can you teach us more assassination skills
you can call me siro meaning white
was tis back when you and two hands and two feet
but your feet are outside the ring
but why is e ere
im so ashamed suck behavior is unbecoming of an educator
dont worry leave tis to me
if not and if they were wearing a school uniform see page
well i wouldnt say im tat fast
ses a soldier twos well equipped to take down a moving target
watching korosensei fall for such an obvious ploy
ill make it worth your while
hell give us tips on our strategy from a prose perspective
my group
you always see new sides of people when you travel together
damn our english teacher only mentioned tat novel in passing in the middle of class
and your plot needs a lot more work
taking the top spot in tree out of five subjects
if no one as any questions ten were done for the day
everyone in the a class studied like mad too
tough your classes should remain unaffected
but ten itll rapidly lose its efficacy and become harmless
if you have some time later on
youre a little late on the comeback there
but how are we gonna find them
when did e
i look forward to it
but whod want something to remember their assassination target by
his face is getting pretty tricked out
and the other students are elite members of a prestigious prep school
you wont be able to pitch is super fastballs wit tat body
one of them will need some time to work out the kinks
ive had a many opportunities trougout my work
he seems larger than life today
now all we can do is leave it up to them
ice trow yesterday
so you try your hardest to understand wat they say
every sigtseeing spot illustrated the top souvenirs
dont be ridiculous
a little something extra by way of apology
one look at tat carved up moon and youll know
why did you get so angry when you saw itona kuns tentacles
all tat luggage and you still forgot something
its like an accordion
and korosenseis threatening to destroy the whole sting makes im a textbook example
five subjects etats japanese english social studies science
now when you get back to your rooms you stay real cool like
as long as you have one of my andmade guidebooks everything will be fine
the students in the other classes get personal hotel rooms
dropout mentality
the only winner youve got is asano kun
wat toe ell kinda guidebook is tat
your target tis time is a teacher currently leading students on a school trip
your whole body stiffens instantly
just wat are you making us junior gig kinds say
a solitary troubled zero wo must save the world
to deceive someone you must understand their feelings
cmon miss bitch are you teaching us or wat
formally e class students arent allowed to set foot on the main campus
weve been tasked wit killing one extraordinary monster
we have a winner karasuma sensei
its often said tat toe fastest way to learn another language
you wont be picking fights and getting into trouble on our trip right
bitch sensei is our english teacher in e class
those notes might come in sandy after all
your shoulder muscles are out of wack compared to aritas
tis stuff could come in super bandy
are you all right
an excellent job especially considering all the fiendis questions you and to deal wit
am i supposed to be proud of tat im an assassin
a little stiff dont you think
tat octopus ittin the sort pole like its the corner shop
theres no sign the enemy as set up camp in any great numbers
even if e is an assassination target
be sure to pick assassination friendly tour routes
we start off whispering about overtrowing the status quon
theyre usually black but these are white
tat gas
giving us real guns
wat youve sucked up there is no ordinary water
after all theres noting tis barrage of bullets couldnt kill
yes well case in our tentacle destroying rights during summer camp
thats to be expected
and how did you avoid et breathing my gas
its possible tat you might have to destroy all is tentacles at once
keep the garden watered kay
lets go back to our room and cat
and its no different from the unwinnable game we always play
tat activity trains their ability to strike a moving target wit a knife
if you determine tat agisa kuns life is in danger
nan nanda iraira no adou wa
korosensei try tis blotting paper
ill take on the task of tutoring im at home
gunsots a scream and now slitery sounds
just like it says on the tin theyll feel even better than before they were sick
waddaya mean youre glad your grades went up
how gimme a yes sir
find an assassination style tat suits yours
wat a hero
gimme a strategy fares outta tat shrewd noggin of yours
ive asked the school to improve tease facilities but they refuse
tis means bitch senseis staying
the temptations of summer are simply too many to mention
ive lived a little longer than you and come to know a little more
yes im fine
now listen ere women have a sort self life
if only there was a poison tat actually worked on im
well if we kill im today we can just enjoy ourselves tomorrow
the rain as let up and tomorrow toe bell will signal the start of another school day
i was the one wo caught it
we cant call you miss bitch anymore
boobs go home
were between you and the exit
i get it
tough your motivation did have a touch of wimsy tat worried me
feeling better
youre probably the strongest one in tis class
you lousy brat
well settle tis fair and square man to man
in the end school and prestige mean noting
faint noting fair about sneakin tat into the fight
shall we set a rule ten
but you know the tentacles tell all
the big booby bating kayanocci opens her heart
and yet is teaching work is close to perfect
he loosened my stiff shoulders and back
wit so little time for learning our gradesll plummet
to kill a man of such character would be unthinkable
it was only a verbal agreement
the students wit the best grades at kunugigaoka academy are entitled to a fantastic privilege
but my features are a bit figner taen tat
and worse fault do you think tat is
sometimes it can be fun being the target right
agisa kun how would you try to poison me
will tis rubber knife really work
proves ses an assassin of the digest caliber
y yea fine
but check their chests
ten is there really no way
and wat about free time we cant do tis
first we had exams and now theres a class trip
the carts covered in ribbons
i saw im use is tentacles to shield you from wind pressure and dust particles
making fun of me for going to some closer gig school
tomorrow we return to our lives at school
are you worried about tis class firepower
but if you cant be both an assassin and a teacher
at the foot of sanneizaka a student will distract im wit souvenirs
youre too dark
students wit good grades get priority use of school funds
special moves supersonic speed
saw youre giving us omework
all right sounds like a fun diversion
black tentacles
two very special assassins to join is class
they move very deliberately to make it appear tat way
feel free to stay behind bitch sensei
we got a lot of prep work done thanks to you
dont you think we should get some kind of reward
dropout mentality
the actors are leading the target around nicely
o thank you korosensei
o one would mind being in the same group wit der
the student council events are explained on the andouts youve just been given
but it looks like the only thing youve shaken is your hesitation
his face as so many unique colors
well find our target and unleas our bloodtirst
gave me a lympatic beauty massage
theres more than one kind of talent
ill need all new supplies
ill negotiate wit my superiors to resume my teaching position
but the key is tat final killing blow
we start off whispering about overtrowing the status quon
how can you be so sure
ive already given you report cards to sow your parents
more than worst the effort of disguising myself id say
man class is such a pain
and from now until nigtfall im gonna teach you just how much lower you can go
tis was the locations of omiya the inn were sakamoto was assassinated in
your english grades are noting to sneeze at
my parents
you grew so much from tat one defeat
several allied nations avez pooled their tecnology for research purposes
tat was one fun school trip
you know etats overkill
the real question is wo voted for wo
the majority will work harder fueled by pressure and a sense of superiority
so you gonna kill me
youll all pay for tis
left to is own devices come next march ell blow up the earth
bitch sensei youre only twenty
the closer dies brother
i wanted to kidnap you back ten but you slipped troug my fingers
theyll want the scorning standard to include how much a student reads and how adaptable se can be
tat broke so fast it practically disappeared
take in now wat it means to win and wat it means to lose
unarmed id beat down a terrified new recruit word never held a knife before
im sure tat one day your scientific talents will benefit many
and last but not least korosensei the very model of an ideal teacher
let tat octopus teach you wat you need to know for your exams
do you think thats strange of me
when did e get in there wit the actors
at the head of the class stands a creature wo vaporized seventy percent of the moon
hes just a boastful brat swinging around a rusty sword
tat guidebooks amazingtats toe perfect way to foil an abduction
just wat i wanted for my afternoon tea
i mean we beat them on total scores
the sniper spot weve chosen
after tat our tropical island assassination tour began in earnest
it paint like you got a vision for really killing im
just the right yelping and for a bunch of crass is guys to have around
my talent
the entire class together couldnt take down tis monster
the skills
youre copying major leagues pitcher arita arent you
yes tough their argument was rather tenuous
i am irina jelavic a prop among prose
everyone there saw how much i outranked them and became my faithful devotees
theyd never drag others down wit team quite unlike you
i tougt id come pay my respects
he dug is own grave
were to over all five subjects
thats far more than youd stand to gain from a bunch of useless scoolwork
even when girls pull off something cool so effortlessly
time for a second term full of hard work in studying and assassination alike
but we wont be using tease old things
well ritsu swan was telling all those scary stories
im okay
e is the assassination classroom
but maybe youll be better off as a teacher
you cant lose irina sensei do your best
why tis even as academic value
perfect
well find our target and unleas our bloodtirst
perfect is right
but if your opening move is to call in reinforcements
everything we need to do is right there
maximum instantaneous velocity measured at kilometers per our
as her students watch and learn per spirit of challenge
sowing my serious side will just ruin my caracterization
will find their presence fading in our classroom
kill im by next march
first in the year level goes to asano gakusuu of the a class
well find our target and unleas our bloodtirst
yes fear is a must in education
o i get it
tis seems like a good chance
not a boat anything but a boat
hes writing test questions
you havent yelped wit anyone elses assassination terasaka
agisa did you figure out twos in your group yet
someone wo can be respectfully wary of their opponent
at a tokyo arcade last summer
but dont tell those two about our little arrangement
these ratings are just between us guys okay
if they kill im theyll save the world
e class as its own special building far away from the main campus
in tis segment ill teach you all about kunugigaoka academy
even bitch sensei cant say no to im
ill drag you down to our level all right
having the verbal aptitude to deceive others is a vital part of assassination okuda sand
a straight sot from yasakas five story pagodas
were the only guests and these are nice and comfy
your smiles were a little forced
someone cut tis rope and trigger the trap
and lecturing a child wo dates to study
live ammo and real guns
youll be fine
akamura riot
since im feeling better and all
sorry we hammered out a strategy
here in tis bizarre classroom tat came about because of tat creature
hes not smiling not serious
you have no further reason to fight us right
theres no need to negotiate
wit your body your strength
you should train too bitch sensei
hes just plain smitten
tis is not a gun but a transmitter tat will send us a signal
to understand people places and the atmosphere
wait dwy agisa
i mean someone in our class
so wat did you want to talk about irina sensei
considering the hearts current crisis you must speak of them to no one
so naturally youll need a real knife
theyll stick you in tat satellites campus wit no meals filthy toilets
for colleagues you and karasuma sensei are like night and day
training until nine at night
like you care about anything but sweets
plus karma happened to point me to a tree wit some good bugs on it
wat toe ell could e be any more sadistic
those guys are no strangers to crime
i can draw a steady beard on im ere
tat monster showed up out of nowhere
a poison thatll kill im
it surges as we look up into the moon
watched a movie and ten came back come
the target is currently rushing to their aid
at my age if you know about these youre cool
lets slowly savor our meal as we take in the night sea
we gotta force ourselves to try to look cool
im glad youre ere lend me a and
hey wat the bells e doing
you sure about tat karma
wat is tis wave of nervousness
all spraying ammo wit superlative speed and firepower
and did tat slitery tinge wit is tentacles
its just like your traps kuraasi
its a prose job to have both tecnique and connections
he seems like the lazy laid back type at first glance
dont forget to play wit me too
tests are a good thing
you foolish foolish man
and thats why sorry to say none of you will be dying
mix together water and potato starc
my eyes arent seeing anything red are they
all right korosensei after dinner comes the assassination
and in tis classroom korosensei
indeed im going to hawaii to see a movie
hes sure taking is sweet time
the girl of many dreams
acute u
karasumas not part of our family
bitch sensei
in such a situation see page of the appendix
and the onlookers wo cheer and jeer
i bought em to see how electricity worked on tat octopus
his weak points are the same as korosenseis right
we make it look like were having fun but were dead serious
isnt it a bit risky having a state secret so obviously out in public
all right understood
the students almost got me to spilld toe beans about my love life
are you trying to stick up for me
you must be sick of plain old assassinations korosensei
but soon enough well feel like crying out arg
theyre still hard to breed
and tat weapon you have will do the job perfectly
class e at kunugigaoka junior high is the assassination classroom
hes dodging or blocking every blow
do i look like im just raving fun ere
but will it really work tat well
i do ope you can
we start off whispering about overtrowing the status quon
wat do you think
well lose track of wat all our hard work as been for
im a bit embarrassed for you to see wat it pricks up
kinds our age have always admired tat character type
migite to migiasi isso ni desou da
theres a woman wholl woleeartedly challenge and master even the things ses no good at
if you think prose will do anything for money you got another stink coming
and when they work as a pair their knives it the mark more often now
yea well come to think of it we never really considered the safety of it all
o yea
if you want to stay ere and continue going after im
im working on a curveball tat puts my elbows and wrists to good use
sure youre not just saying tat because you want to eat stem
the upcoming trip promised to make our days even more action packed than usual
well like no natural born octopus can move at mack
if we keep tis up well definitely get our chance to kill im
go on ahead my brother
like an octopus wo practically pulsed books onto you
wat already
a father doesnt want to lose even a single one of is children
no wonder the governments trying so hard to cover up the matter
the rules are simple whoever kills karasuma sensei first wins
wat kind of lesson is tis
the rest work on their preparations
here have some soda and popcorn
its a home made trap of mine
of course sensei
your gun and knife skills arent tat much better than ours
taking you kinds seriously is more important than the end of the world
you never tell us anything about your private life
i dont think well ever warm up to her
and once they grew up they began their destined battle
ill kill karasuma and you all on my own
target of mine
the difference experience makes
even wit tis andicap im much faster than any of you
when im forever alone
in one fluid motion swiftly draw your second blade and
say how about we teach em a lesson in kyoto
asano can really nab those points
figures kanzakis in first place
if you have no leads on the perpetrator
hes putting away tat candy like nobodys business
stop and smell the flowers and learn how to smile less maliciously before you try again
however se just happens to be the kind of assassin my class needs
even so our youth will be eternal
wait you have parents
but theres great eagerness for mischief in those eyes
tat tentacle is yours
how about a crash course in picking up women from your car
o one would blame you for being shaken after tat terrible event
but a mere sliver of a satisfactory answer does not an laced exam make
rather they will choose a secluded spot nearby
dropout mentality
theres no mistaking tat face
it surges as we look up into the moon
whats wit all the crying over noting
ten dont bring such an enormous bag
a teachers happiest moment
were going on our fourth month of training
our teacher moves incredibly fast and is tentacles can do all kinds of things
you can do it yes you can go
the next group you were supposed to work wit group
wat is tis wave of nervousness
you have all of tomorrow
probably kunugigaoka
we sent our demand via email
see my familys pretty poor
wat is tis wave of nervousness
any luck agisa
making poison wit toe target
either way were gonna have to beat em to get by
clues
real science isnt any fun if its just memorization
when im foundling for research purposes my tentacles are never wrong
a lady never neglects fashion just because ses traveling
its all good well just kill im tomorrow
following tis curriculum will boost your abilities by leaps and bounds
wat we saw today etats wat korosensei sees all the time
you could stop a bullet wit tis stuff
begin

thats right youre a hero
unfortunately it never happened

anxiety is always nearby
i have something amazing to tell you

i guess we have tat in common
i want to believe in myself

the uniforms for the music students are really acute
hey sawa tow busy is sio these days

dont assume were out of the running because we didnt know about tis
mairu told us se wanted us to write our own song

tis world of winning and losing isnt as nice as you think
you made me feel tis way
mabinogions rainbow manuscript chapter tree verse one

indeed we carry our eight grader syndrome trougout all of our lives
ice to meet you man
the grade scoolers have two options silence or death
thats the last one
its so sticky and stinky and lukewarm
why dont you try listening to all tat
we looked into each others eyes for a while
the part of you tat imagines youre being watched
when youre in love you want to have it all
well i spent a lot of time thinking after wat happened
se can even teleport its truly frightening

whatever you said you cant seriously expect us to just believe it like tat
the true feelings youve been holding back
i dont know were tat is
the dark flame is yuutas strongest offensive spell
how scary can se be
only the powers of darkness may exorcise it
if se listens to wat you and your mother have to say and accepts it itll all be over
i dont wanna go home
whats tat youre folding
takanasi picked it up yesterday
hey dark flame master
when the stars tried to fit in

o matter how many years pass ill love you the most of anyone in tis world
youre sure up early today
its a small country wit a population of thirty thousand

so does anyone ere have the courage to sit in tis chair
buying all those expensive things like its noting
i choose you china
i feel apply
i cant forget tat taste
however it received independence due to the dissolution of the german confederation
after all i made half of them to beat you wit
just wat i said
and according to research it also makes you lazy
dont i look acute
how se replies entirely on switzerland
do be careful
ill check it out you read come
to umans the sense of reality it imparts as always been essential
the legends in history textbooks alone are not enough
thats funny
ten you know about the days when se was an ace
its actually my policy not to trust superiors wo dont smoke

our squadron will probably have to relocate
employees have the right to use tis place and we need to use it once in a while
medium bombers and at iger altitudes heavy bombers
first time youve seen a female mecanic
since ten se hasnt come back yet

of course as long as the previous pilot is still alive
how did you take out two planets in such a sort time
thank you for specially coming to receive us
even now five years after youre like a shimmering eat gaze

come in
im sure youll want to kill stem
when tis is over lets go check out tis town
i really want to line up women like tat and bowl them down armd

these children ere only come to have fun once every two months
ses borne a child
o sorry

thats not her sister
and it absolutely cannot be faked
soot me wit tat gun
find out the problem and write a report
to enjoy himself wit an adult woman
mine was pretty much the same
i ear some tourists are coming to visit

interesting concept isnt it
from the look of things per bones and internal organs should be fine
sowing the world their wretchedness all tat is necessary to preserve peace
repeat ten zero zero minus zero five
dont you put a kill mark on your planed
why didnt you say so at the start
so well be a mixed squadron including someakas from now on
any communication
an urgent message might come in
but other details are not available yet

whoever stoves toe competition hardest and learns the most profit wins
tat woman sot im
im sorry to cause trouble
they got escorts
you wanted to confirm if the bird you saw was the teacher didnt you
while figters and ground attack craft will form team a
at point blank range
the reality of someone fighting somewhere even now

estimated time of contact corrections minus repeat minus
wo cares about guys

kurita jinro took on duties ere seven months ago

you kildren do not age
hes the ace pilot of lautern corps
say i to fuuko for me
i said its okay
how exactly do you connect your endlessly repeating life wit your memories of the past
the planed sank in no time
certain rules become necessary
hes supposedly an adult
and it is reported tat two pilots were killed and another was severely wounded
come in
hes not a poor boy
as if its not their business
wick woman
how was the coffee
tis is my gun
im kannami stationed ere as of today
at my previous base i got to know a volunteer
he was circling overhead earlier
thats her daughter
i see youre a smoker too
it fits me just right somehow
your lazy feelings as if youre watching a dream protecting your mind
im not tat conceited
the drive in
i know war is always horrible
mamma
welcome back
he was once in our corporation
and even the corporation probably knows about the child
how nobody thinks youre a chicken
i dont remember
they wont be able to use anti aircraft cannons
somehow youre completely different from my image of you
im not pleading wit you or anything
se was an extraordinary ace
not wit a guy ace either actually
on the whole idea of visiting
held closely to your cest enveloped in your smell
if you meet im in the sky you wont return alive
from there you will gradually join up wit figters from our various bases
youll fly wit im tomorrow afternoon
they got escorts
my whole familys a big fan of yours were always cheering for your team
even if its the same old road the scenery isnt the same
my uncles are often right
the skylys never flown in tis theater before you know
you seemed to like playing wit children
dunno ive never tougt about it
tree fortunes are evaded for you
warning enemy in sight
wore you i havent seen you before
turned upwards like tis and ten performed a stalls turn
team a will assault the two closer forward bases a step ahead of you
look out tree birds
im not sure close to years maybe
be at the runaway in minutes
ladies and gentlemen you will be participating in a project of unprecedented scale tis afternoon
whats se thinking
call a doctor an ambulance
otherwise is know how as a pilot would have been lost
how long as it been since you joined tis base
to see kusumi
my body feels your love and it reaches all of me too
just based on my experiences so far
thats not enough of a reason im coming over
first eight figters flown by you will take off from tis base
its something like a guestouse
i told her tat we should lead back
does anyone want me to take a picture
you cant just have your way wit a girl ace
theyre coming to sow their support for our corporation
their engines have some quirks
when taking over a planed surely its normal to have contact wit the previous pilot
im not confident tat ive been troug any particular experience
its in the pot on the table if youd like any
well they said they got permission from you
big motor
a fine idea
se broke formation went se saw an enemy bird
bowling
its related to our corporations sponsorship and so on
we really appreciate wat youre doing for us
o damage
yudagawa said something strange
arent they the same
figter control flight to way point
ice to meet you boy
some do but i dont
the skyly ascended from below kisinumas planed
you do right
i dont want to switc if possible
you said it first you know
roger tat
it makes me wisp id and a cildood too
arent there soups or something
how do you all stay in control of your feelings
to kill her own loved one was tat a part of her interference too
tat planets going to be taken back by the vendor
his capability as a weapon would have been lost
tat would be tonight
is tonigts party canceled
how about lautern corps test line
my nice was about becoming friends and being able to cat
aim for a spare
not a poor boy at all
will you visit me again
theyll do everything they can to force us back
still want to play
the sweetest place in tis world is your heart
escorted by figters from eight squadrons and four tactical squadrons
just because its the same pat doesnt mean it always as the same scenery
i got worried looking at im
im a kind too
and before tat how much flight time did you have
wanna do something fun
get a blanket
it was a planed wit the mark of a black painter on its nose
i got no answer
im gonna cover you
the one on the second floor
probably just temporarily tough
try asking the boss ten
is a necessity in the human social system
get out of the way
and it is expected tat more large scale engagements will ensued
its just two
but the rumor steadily spread
its a well behaved town after all
minutes to being out of fuel
your objective is lauterns strongest position located in the central theater
did you know kildren was a brand name of our corporation
tat news is about you gentlemen isnt it
be careful tonight
the engagement as seemed to be halted as a recommendation was hastily issued from the european confederation
and fell into a terrible confusion inflicting heavy casualties to both sides
the mark of the black painter
tell tat to everyone too
its about the pilot wo flew tat planed before me
even tough es a combat pilot
thats why ses maman
hey do you like flying
the strength of the attacking force is according to the statement by rostock
did you come to talk about tat
to meet my guest
were students of yomiyama port junior higs t grade class
my its unusual to see a boy your age ere
i havent told im
lets keep the windows closed
two degrees would mean parents grandparents and siblings
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
second assuming you actually graduateitll be tough selling yourself to employers
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
it can start a month late
hey do you know the story of the class from twenty six years ago
yes and look at the date of the august deaths
why are you ere
you dont suppose something happened to mikami sensei do you
se took her twain sisters baby girl
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
yes but its no different when youre alive is it
how could we not make the most of the outdoor life
we started grappling and ended up outside on the balcony
o need to apologize
the dining all
are you going back to the hospital today
and tat es currently doingresearc in a foreign country
kirikas studio
since may we have experienced noting but misfortune
how does it feel to not exist
kirikas studio
do any club members come in over summer break
was named misaki
are you in pain
is drawing your hobby
o thats not conclusive
but now es turned into tis pseudo donors student wo cant keep up wit my improve
want to go check out tat amusement park
my dead will be back in japan by next spring
twins
tis battle ends in a draw
se shouldnt have even been in the same school as you
do you ever cook
raise your blood stained talons
mr kubodera asked me to send you to the faculty room
is something wrong
theres a right time to find out about everything
i have to do a good job
everyone in the class continued wit tat act
do you like art
but there are several other theories
i it you wit an empty can
didnt you bring an umbrella
should we go back to the hotel
were at the beac
wat is studio m
dont fear the evil in them
but moments after we all took off blindly running troug the rain
ill avenge my brother
wat were you doing out in the rain yesterday
its the lemons scream
there is no malice to be found
it happened years ago
i guess not
but her baby never came into tis world
youre not used to tis place so youd better not stay ere
youre going to school tomorrow right
something weird is going on
the feeling of uneasiness enveloping the world
wat happened once you knew the truth
cant believe its been years since they died
wat was the patients name
i see mocizuki kun hasnt changed
tis one
say we do figure out wo it is
se didnt come to school today
so not often
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
mine wont work either
matsunaga sans case was pure coincidence
a year and a half away from yomiyama
so you were sisters not cousins
why would se use one so far away
just as the colors fade from old film
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
is tis a doll shop
i obviously couldnt tell you
dont fear the evil in them
how the fourth thing you need to know to prepare yourself for yomi port is
be careful
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
tell me wat happened to class
hey owes tat lungs of yours doing
yomiyamas a pretty small town isnt it
how far out are you gonna go
both the teachers and students adored her
wat brings you ere today
but as a librarian not a teacher
hey isnt tat your house over there
except wit certain things
h hello
if it were tat easy to tell
does tat mean its going to happen again tis year
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
is tis one of those class rules
aiku is a type of fixed form poetry consisting of seventeen syllables
but it just takes some getting used to
give me a break
o not really
are you hurt
ive started to wonder if its me twos dead
the thing is tat girl wit the eye patch said her name is misaki mein
it didnt seem like a good idea to stay confined at home
two degrees would mean parents grandparents and siblings
o way
so youve run before
tis is part of being the head of countermeasures
im just another one of her dolls
whats the rest of the story
the cistern obliteration caused by cerebral contusion had already progressed significantly
our principal doesnt even truly understand our situation
raise your blood stained talons
i tried to call your cell prone
the painting draws out tat emotion
there is a second me
classmates shouldnt do something as stupid as killing one another
i dont think so
how does it feel to be back after a year and a half away from yomiyama
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
why are you asking me tis
there was a student in tat class
its about tat girl wo died at the hospital
im not sure but
and the story tat started it all years ago
u sure
there is a second me
there is a second me
a girl again
i dont agree wit tow akazawa is dandling tis
o tat explains the static
a thats a delicate issue
did you speak wit her on the prone around pm yesterday
but it will be all right
wit all the stuff you brought i souldve known
it came from downstairs right
he didnt say anything about wat appenedtwenty six years ago or the accident last week
wat is misaki swan like
right after se told me tat accident happened
things tat dont exist
idiot
its a bit of a weird class really
o im from tokyo
itd be safest to stay locked up at home
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
im sorry are you all right
so an optalmology patient
why would they bring a new student to class anyway
do we really need to be connected troug them all the time
a local business donated its recreation center
thats right the situation as changed
color
has your suspicion been laid to rest
when they consider tat they might be next
but wat did e side there
bow before the strength of a working girl
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
if we kill misaki the calamity will end
was left behind years ago when the calamity stopped midyear
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
there is a second me
ill help you die
youre free to come ere whenever you please
but it may be too late
o sorry
ive never seen my mother so flustered
hes kind of blurry compared to the others in the proto
did you find tat class proto from years ago
however shortly after the second term began
well just say you were concerned for a classmate
thats under investigation
there are two possibilities
id be in your place suffering just like you are now
are you going back to school
falling from two stories up wouldnt necessarily kill im
why do you want to know about her
hey sakakibara kun
everything okay wit your lungs now
was e acting strange
and ten se showed up in the class graduation proto
stupid
the principal even arranged to have
i like it
lets go back upstairs
se didnt want you to meet your birth mother
new dolls are put in ere
id like to study carving and sculpting
we will rote away under tis empty sky
o noting
sakakibara kun knows about the first year
but ses not a bad person
has your brother ever mentioned her
we will rote away under tis empty sky
there are no guarantees
and e said
tis is kelp right
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
they say it happened years ago
u wat was
but hollow things seek to fill their emptiness
they said matsunaga kun was suddenly called to a reception
all right ten noon
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
tat class and just left for a class trip on august
wheres tat outer girl wo came to visit me akazawa sand
im not certain
im pretty sure tat was is name
wat happened on tat trip
my favorite is the cold rain tat falls in midwinter
are you listening
but the second abasement level is
he was dead serious
not at all
why didnt you tell me tat day
wat exactly does the head of countermeasures do
why not
how very tired i am of funerals
were both close to death after all
o dont tell me
does tat make sense
wait arent class strips usually a ninth grade sting
as for tat story you asked about yesterday
for a second my vision went white
are you okay wit tis
are you okay
you prefer big cities
ill say it after i find out for sure
thats why i like it
does tat mean we need new countermeasures
when did we start
o i just left the hospital
wat did you mean
your body is covered in blood red ice
hold on the signal ere is bad
so wat are you reading these days
o way
mocizuki the art club meets in tat building right
sakakibara knows about the first year
my parents want me to go wit them to their summer house
to tell you the truth i dont remember much
o never
a fire
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
so her parents were devastated
i took something to the school
theres one outer tinge tat boters me
rein is your name you know
like if it was a note or something else
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
so wat are you reading these days
se comes ere often
wat happened to your eye
do you remember the class trip we took tat summer
dont mess wit things tat dont exist
the calamity and my work as head of countermeasures
you mentioned the first year too
raise your blood stained talons
will you come wit me to see im
but i didnt bring my trunks
you like dolls
thats why i remain at tis school
my its unusual to see a boy your age ere
it shows in her acting
the dolls
really
you think so
so we decided to visit you on behalf of the entire class
misakis still inside
was the faculty room
they just gave me a tour of the school
the police came to see us about the lightning and the fall
akazawa swan is in charge of countermeasures
or it started in may
tis is now the lemon looks to me
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
well hum
and yet the calamity began in april
dont ever speak tat name in class
outing will change tat fact
we came ere today as representatives of class
se made tis doll based on the daughter wo never and a chance to live
fear tat i might die as well
do you mind if we leave it wit you
se didnt look too good
you mean you can tell when people are about to die
so youre leaving town
se and clearly been murdered
so my mother went there too
for family reasons
shut up
just last mount even kubodera sensei became a victim
your body is covered in blood red ice
and if we need their help at tat point ten we can
thats part of the rule
a rumor walks alone
mikami sensei was special to you right
so tat must make you yuuyas friend too
why are you ere
fancy meeting you ere again
raise your blood stained talons
i almost died from fright
a lot of club members will be around ten
there are also seaside shops
you were holding some kind of white doll
wat should we do
goodbye mother
as soon as youre discharged ill tell you everything you need to know about yomi mort
mikami sensei died in fall a year and a half ago
the calamity was stopped midyear years ago
do you have something else to ask me
but were going on a class trip for tree days and two nights from august t to the t
in the class thats so old
some people say dolls like these are creepy
the person wo makes tease dolls
a friend of yours izumi can
tecnically its only been years since our graduation
its because the plan to make one person nonexistent worked
by ten se also knew tat we were twins
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
thats your big one
in the classroom
its just not fair
im cibiki toe librarian
yours doesnt look like it can handle four
the hollow blue eyes of yomi at twilight
is tis right
as head of countermeasures
we dont avez gym wit another class
at school im the assistant omeroom teacher mikami sensei at all times
i wonder
he seems to enjoy it immensely
dont fear the evil in them
o i only went to the funerals
come on anything but morning
take a look at tis flawless setup
check on wat
you know ritsuko was a very special lady
ill pick toe teams
i woke up one day and the eye was gone
damn it
i dont want to die
the master of the library
weve been together since nd year of elementary
one of our regulars is a man named matsunaga katsumi
your body is covered in blood red ice
why do you all look so serious
to the future students wo are undoubtedly suffering from the senseless disaster of tis class
the important thing to understand is tat
se was probably planning to keep it a secret my whole life
cibiki sensei is the drama clubs advisor
great ineptitude as the head of countermeasures
its much much closer to it than any of the other classes
wat is it
when my mom died years ago
everything tat and to do wit mikami reiko
se was loved by teachers and students alike
my mom said a regular artificial eye wouldnt be attractive
after they implemented it nobody else died
but it only became the secondary one after the new building was constructed
anyone up for lunch
and since the second floor is barricaded
hey i exist
the girl named misaki mein
you were
but we were sort a desk once the new student came
it uses the characters from the future and to bloom
a few things seem strange to me
tat is the question
its not a curse
yea and it was breaking my heart
as the countermeasures officeri cant risk betting on uncertainties
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
your body is covered in blood red ice
were you taking tat doll to your cousin after se passed away
half of tat was just me running away
last time we were ere it terrified me
were you drawing something
hey twere got some time
just because my name is misaki
its empty
theres no girl like tat in our class
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
but my school
im certain theres something going on
im a student of the rd year class of
its your birthday too you know
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
so it can start a month late
on the second day
its been two weeks since the trip
had you heard tat story
spring marks is first year there
were did everyone go during sixty period
did e say anything to you
a girl in class
dont fear the evil in them
saw etats too bad
ritsuko was in class
especially their parents and siblings
it was during the fifth year of elementary school right
they said it was a junior gig school girl
you know the whole story now right
so wat are you gonna do about gig school
so i usually keep it covered
se told me tat right before the accident last week
it developed a nasty tumor
wat did you go to the second abasement level for
its true ses alive
are these other potos your moms too
octopuses dont eat people
yea tomorrow
you mean near death experiences
the situation as changed
dont forget yukaris mom died as well
in the classroom
you cant expect me to
are you a junior gig student
antisocial always dressed in black
but ten se was furious
im not the one you should be worried about
dont fear the evil in them
an explosion in the dining all probably
tis holds copies of all class rosters
but to be honest theyre not very good
yes i feel much better
will you come see me later
hes a class officer and the guy youve always been stuck wit
and you can only see tat color in people wo are dead
ten wat kind of girl do you like sakakibara kun
masaoka siki coined the term around one hundred years ago
but thats a lie
theres a legend in tis town
you get maejima kun someplace safe
today
didnt you bring an umbrella
a funeral always follows ones dealt
ill be sure to take extra good care of you
because i wasnt in the class back in april
when is your next physical
the whole class including the teacher
probably the one in the middle
at least it wasnt thrown away i guess
wat do you mean
you have a brother
theyre ere about wat happened years ago
half of me was crushed by guilt
my left eye is a dolls
but its not over
about class of years ago
but i couldnt connect
but in return youll have to tell me tat reason sometime
both the name and the x
but even if you dont like wat happens
death is not kind
its about tat girl wo died at the hospital
into an old geezer
i was born wit it
hi mocizuki senpai
tat storys been swirling around for years
before tat toe poems were called aikai
do you think its the curse
and after we prayed our teacher confidently declared
the crunc is so delicious
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
are you a customers or perhaps
hes also a customers at the gallery downstairs
se might be sick
besides izumi seems fond of you
there are only five classrooms
but soon after starting rd year se suddenly
and it began to rain
are you okay
we are near the ocean after all
tis is your go get em call be grateful
most people would say thats just a coincidence
sakuragi and i are class officers
could there be any other explanation
is the battery dead
man the rains gotten worse
mizuno
its bitter but also sweet
se ado twins
dolls are follow you see
do you realize wat you said
you are seriously weird
wit the character tat means sing
you left before the exam period ended yesterday too
come on sakaki dont get so down
im not very good at drawing tough
there is a second me
we will rote away under tis empty sky
rural areas like yomiyama avenoting going for them these days
youve come back to life as a transfer student in class
so se knew the rumors about class
for a cell prone
talking about mikami sensei over ere
thats why i decided to come clean ere
is tat blood
you really are weird misaki
mother still ropes you can forgive her
ses a strange woman wo isolates herself in the studio upstairs
last monday
talent is a key factor of course
mizuno takeru he plays basketball
id love to live in tokyo
se and a dark blue blazer sort air
you really were the model for tat doll werent you
the countermeasure would have succeeded
tat means seven people died in the calamity two years ago
were looking for a clue to stopping the calamity
just old on okay sakaki
thats probably dwy se makes me carry a cell prone
it looks like making two students not exist didnt work
when did you figure out tat reiko sand
sum its a lemon
the third one was to always uphold the class rules right
hey there good morning howre you doing
being connected to people all the time by electromagnetic waves disturbs me
thats the school youll be attending
and youre surrounded by nature
you can get some at the hotel
it wasnt as if my finding out would change anything
it makes no sense to go on a class trip in the summer
but only half
apparently i said tat but
please give our new friend a warm welcome class
you see dolls are follow
it started in may tis year right
but it was not on the roster for
one of them can see me
dont fear the evil in them
hes been there about a year tis spring
there are tree important rules for composing aiku
others claim se died in a house fire
the feeling of uneasiness enveloping the world
are you all right
i dont think so
wat are you drawing
in fact i love the cold midwinter rain
the deceased in was named asakura mami
tis matsunaga guy stopped the calamity
its a little late but do you want to grab lunch somewhere
i had noting to do
i think its possible
hey kouici something going on there
the hollow blue eyes of yomi at twilight
thats ridiculous
wo excelled in sports and her studies
call the police and an ambulance now
tat building is several decades old
wat is studio m
the third thing you need to know to prepare yourself for yomi port is
if theres anything you need dont hesitate to ask
tis dolls eye tells me youre not
but hollow things seek to fill their emptiness
as soon as we left the shrine
yea like getting caught in our own trap
ten do you know the story about the class of years ago
at any rate youre stuck wit me until graduation
of responsibility for the disasters weve faced
there seems to be only one countermeasure tat effectively fights tis phenomenon
of course i have
yea i have
they just gave me a tour of the school
sounds interesting
dont fear the evil in them
sakakibara kun you can take tat seat there
but in the end we couldnt save either of them
and not to brag
thanks but ill pass on the tea
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
i just happened to be the one
by the way you have exams coming up right
once its begun
my eyelids all swollen up
some people say dolls like these are creepy
your body is covered in blood red ice
so her parents were devastated
the third thing you need to know to prepare yourself for yomi port is
first off on the head of countermeasures team will be
okay lets play it
tat ones going to be a tougie
it was so old and run down
i nominated myself
misakis seat included in their graduation ceremony
the guy wo swears noting but black
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
id like to study carving and sculpting
weve kept all the rooms open for you
is there a connection between these accidents
significance
do you remember wick rd year class my mom was in
aiku is a sort form of poetry consisting of syllables
hey theres something else i want to ask you
high school acceptance rates are over these days
maybe no one else actually believed in the calamity
has the auxiliary library always been in tat room
you could see the color of death in yomiyama misaki
do you understand the situation now sakakibara kun
and its summer break
until suddenly someone said it
you mentioned the first year too
i ope so
theres really no way
maybe a blessing from the shrine stopped the calamity
i cant allow such a senseless phenomenon to exist
how did akao kun seem tat day
tat was unnecessary
se was the dead person tat year
is it
if the misakis took in a daughter named misaki
im surprised by now strong willed you are
however if the calamity begins
i heard her mother died in an accident tat same day
in tat case ill give you calf price
so se was loved by students and teachers alike
and can you see the grounds beyond it
his surname was yomiyama like tis town
look at the roster from two years ago
do you feel ill
if i said tat would you not do it
ill pass
just make sure to carefully consider your actions
you have a brother
i see noting tat souled affect regular school attendance
whats your main reason
se claims nobody else in the class can see her
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
he actually gives pretty solid acting advice
it seems silly to think tat way now
i start school today
wat do you mean
not a good place
im sorry grandma
tis may seem abrupt
did tat happen
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
thats the yomiyama river flowing troug the center of the town
why would they even put a newly transferred student into class
but theres no point in watching from up close
we looked so much alike after all
the records revert to their original state
but if thats wat you want to do you might as well try
a girl in class died
the extra student was already
how do you know
the killer mustve started the fire
youre going to school tomorrow right
yes altoug tat was years ago
your body is covered in blood red ice
there doesnt seem to be
we didnt get to ear the important part
you dont have to worry
your body is covered in blood red ice
so se made a special one for me
always uphold the class rules
something happened tat made me wonder
thank you for having us for the next tree days
now on the onexistent team will be
always uphold the class rules
probably
a school
o sure
i tried calling your cell
a very unfortunate accident
open your eyes and bare the darkness within
not ere we go during the nd year fall term
should you be up ere
regardless everyone in the class was terribly shocked
a popular student suddenly died
a popular student suddenly died
are you in pain
i heard the class was saved once by doing tat
there have been many depressing events as of late
i saw kazami kun
god damn it
when we first met at the hospital
we have yet to ear one word of apology from her
are your grades tat big
i see
youve been acting like my big sister all day
its on the second floor
local fare of course
its probably best to stay away from tat class
everyone knows
from rd year class
ten why do you have one
the one twos born first is older
raise your blood stained talons
ive been wanting to tell you something since yesterday
was anyone hurt
i picked up some meat and vegetables
i see
it was probably tat old crone
i knew you were gonna arrive soon
there is a second me
checking records is pointless
you dont have to tell me right now
anyway toe students panicked and bolted
were all alone
by the way mikami sensei dropped by today too
i see
odd eye too
were even neighbors
by the way wat country is your dead in now
your body is covered in blood red ice
its dangerous
im playing it
why do you want to know
color of death
probably wont be able to join in gym class tough
were you speaking wit her at around one oclock yesterday
as for tat story you asked about yesterday
one of the guys in my kendo club is in class
mikami sensei is in a difficult position
theres a rumor tat dead people have sockingly cold hands
sum was the misaki of years ago a boy or a girl
wat should we do until ten
wat if i just kept myself slim
but youd best be prepared
youre about to leave for school arent you
my kind brother told me
i see
but suddenly someone said
its not you
a shrine
the principal even arranged to have her seat
i guess so the unstoppable flow of time sure is cruel
the hollow blue eyes of yomi at twilight
and faint in those wit serious illnesses or injuries
i made you a copy of all notes from the start of the first term
we looked exactly the same
yea thats right
lets go upstairs
itll be difficult to explain it to im now
you idiot
o tat explains the static
blood was coming from is dead
i just transferred ere
otherwise wit our wings and feet tripped from us
once exams are over we start career counseling
yea pneumotorax isnt the end of the world
is something wrong
usually theyre appointed by the teacher
did a girl die at tis hospital last monday
is it based on some kind of model
thats how to stop the calamity once its begun
were ninth grade students in class of yomiyama port junior high
you dont have to tell me now
he was lying still on the ground below
theres a fire get out of ere
they say it happened years ago
saying tesigawara was acting weird
if you get a new one can i call you once in a while
since were outside yomiyama the calamity shouldnt affect us
some say it was a car accident
he seemed completely skeptical tough
and stop by all the rooms and tell everyone to get out
is everything okay
my my name is matsunaga katsumi
right the shrine
not even our families
i dont think so
i was in the cooking club at my old school
so two students died in accidents on tat trip
wat are you drawing tesigawara kun
thats why while my memory is still clear
theres noting to connect those two things
i believe tat the memories we have in common
id like to go to a fine arts school if possible
hur cook
whats your name
didnt a girl in your class recently die in an accident too
i ope so
thats how to stop the calamity once its begun
yea tat was really close
well wat is it you want to talk about
like a puppet tat was
the records and memories just go back to normal
wat brings you ere today
youre toe extra person in the class arent you
probably
wo still lived wit is mother
like a puppet tat was
got a minute
o noting
i heard akao kun was it by a boat
if only i could get my coworkers to read is stuff too
i wasnt in the same class as her
but things got complicated because
im living wit my grandparents
an eyepatc
of course you have every right to refuse
my feelings for her advent changed a bit
se didnt come to school today
they heard a loud noise from the stairway tat morning
my mom died right after se and me
these days gig school acceptance rates are over
well ill leave you guys alone
but when i asked im about mein
brother
for sure
help out each other and work armd together
has everyone lost their minds
at the meeting
thats why i decided to come clean ere
hey why dont we give you a tour of the school during lunch
dont involves yourself wit things tat dont exist
ill be your tour guide
were looking for a clue to stopping the calamity
hamaguci had been struck by lightning
strictly speaking there were ten victims in august
se said se liked my house because it was full of pretty dolls
anyway i rarely talk to my little brother but e did tell me a few things
but i couldnt tell them anything about
have teachers died too
you were holding some kind of white doll
a school
se was stabbed by an unknown assailant near the river
i saw the words wo is dead scribbled on your desk
is tat really now you want to draw it mocizuki
by the way wat country is your dead in now
tat storys been swirling around for years
wat about now
still youre stuck wit me until graduation
o yea lets go to the amusement park tomorrow
would you be interested in the art club
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
im sure youll get used to it in no time
but there are several other theories
are you listening
why dont you ride in tis car
tis is wat mikami sensei came ere to discuss wit me today
everyone was overcome wit grief
you okay
you sure seem energetic
youre her daughter per flesh and blood
by the way you checked im out right
his full name was yomiyama misaki
but it looks like it really is true
why did you transfer
o noting
werent you going to tat sacred heart something or other girls school
whats wrong wit your left eye
bet it would just turn out to be cibiki
was there anyone named tat in class
im calling to wish you good luck be grateful
im so very tired of funerals
so wat are you gonna do about gig school
are in my way
you said you wondered if its you whos dead
mom was in class in rd year too right
all right
i can get there by myself
i didnt want anyone telling you its hereditary
but without some luck on your side youre likely to fail
ill call if i find anything out
we will rote away under tis empty sky
maybe youre mistaking me for someone else
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
if you do have to be ospitalized again
and blackness is the cradle of your soul
it wasnt tat easy
dont you think thats a bad idea now
yea im okay
you promised youd tell me in june
praying at the shrine had no effect whatsoever
so seven people died in
altoug it used to be in the rd year spring term
you know i heard something about the class trip
well if it was before
and peoples memories change too right
it was a matter of supply and demand
especially were unusual accidents are concerned
theres something weve gotta do right away
wit the character tat means cry
the color of things close to death
we do
i just well
and how do we let im know
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
if anything comes up use tis number
im sakakibara a third year in class
but i believe it is futile to speak of such things now
some say it was a car accident
sell probably give me a new one soon tough
got it mister horror lover
i went to shout middle
a normal guy
some years it works others it fails
think of it as something etats in the past
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
i havent decided
im not sure yet how it relates wit anything
i want a copy of the class roster
another one twos trying too hard for noting
does tat mean the deaths stopped in august
i didnt want anyone telling you its hereditary
we should be safe ere
o my sister is
whats your name
you girls be careful
did the accident happen before you visited the shrine or after
all right
but tat was the trigger tat opened the door to death
i braced myself and asked im
only the first year
and nobody remembers ever being in the class
we have to spread our wings a little
wo was the model for tat
a thats a delicate issue
i ate to say it but im happy you think so
any others
one night in may is louse burned down
starting tomorrow were two of a kind
wat about the color
dont you know someone wo was in matsunaga sans class
ready set drunk
damn it
it seems a bit extravagant for a school group if you ask me
the student they close to not exist ended up renouncing the role
are you a customers or perhaps
wat color is reiko sand
wick loves someone so much it draws blood
are you a fan of munc
he doesnt stink tat the incident last week was an accident
the calamity hasnt been stopped
unfortunately we were talking about something a little darker
i believe no one wouldve died
a youre in the theater club
sum yea
and explaining it poorly could be dangerous
yea im right outside
wat about you didnt you go to school
your body is covered in blood red ice
it was convenient for the school
its the schools most famous secret
we will rote away under tis empty sky
your left eye
the whole family died parents and brother included
sorry were swamped during the day
so you were born at yomiyama hospital
thats right
its not in line wit toe objective of the class
my family moved to tokyo shortly after tough
its huge and so pretty
youre already in junior gig arent you
i have to do a good job
just before it turns into snow
all we could do was call for help at the foot of the mountain
dont fear the evil in them
my wat a way to start your life ere
the other is to give you some advice
how does tis town compare to tokyo
its the first time ive ever seen tat color so clearly in a proto
i doubt its true tough
especially were unusual accidents are concerned
in addition all memories of her as the deceased are lost
shouldnt the teachers explain it to im
ten its a lie tat people wont die if they leave yomiyama
kirika swan doesnt make lunches for you
in tat case ill give you calf price
tat was my intent
are you a junior gig student
hes hurt
wat does tis mean
thats something youd only ear from a tokyoite
and its been troug numerous structural modifications
but the other half was ruled by fear
the lemon is covering its earsbecause its afraid of tat scream
our pones havent been working since yesterday we cant make calls
and how to stop the calamity
you think tis was a result of the phenomenon
those wit a red x by their names are the ones wo died tat same year
ten outer students started saying the same thing
youre such an idiot
tis is easier taen looking in a mirror dont you think
there was something se wanted to formally discuss
their faces look so peaceful
but ere the group matters more than the individual
my mother kirikas real name is yukiyo
there are tree important rules for composing aiku
se was on the roof at the time correct
about class from years ago
are you sure
maybe i should snack on you instead
your race sure is easy to please
i feel loved
carl was run over by a horse cart
and thats how my first job as a mediator
why would you say theres a problem
sorry each person can only be god once
while the position as lost its former importance
convenient
a akata sand
is tis a city defense mechanism
are you an enemy
so youve never met your employers
the documentation mentioned upper management but
ive never met any of them before
heres your lunch
i can fly
naturally it would be impossible for me
ill go and find the upper management by myself
you want to increase the areas level of fun
thats wat makes tis job difficult for everyone
one single little coin can make you apply
the unseen and of god
whats for dinner sins
cap sand
today they served turkish cuisine
compensation
yes if i was only good at bobbing
well it beats leaving a bad reputation
the opposite of easy
a name
they come wit a mic to help you express your tougts
so tall
tat defiles logic
director why are you ere
todays menu was extravagant
just a single spark will set them off
i dont know why
one two tree four
materials being mass produced without any human intervention
whenever a chicken was touched by human bands
a fine lady must be elegant
we umans are the old humanity
human are you god are you
wit suspicious items being smuggled into the village
ive only and it a few times
wat does tat yucky part mean
plenty of meat
from the moment we entered tis factory
the compass isnt stopping because were at the center
the subtitles are a little blurry
a fairy
truth finder
defective product disposal area
thats how you wanna play
we waited for ten minutes
im lying
so wat were you talking about
akata sand
how tat we have eliminated the evil chickens tat tried to supplant the fairies
hooray for peace on earth
so you were responsible for smuggling the goods
theres no problem
sure wat name do you want
the fairies were operating tis factory
not exactly
heroic actions
but im not a god
and also good at her job
fairy could you reproduce and dismantled the factory
only if i have fun
the director is the manager
im jumping between the gapes in my memory
made me do a lot of thinking
its my lifes work
i know noting about any smuggling
youre quite a clever girl
in any case you did a good job
you know you have to tell a joke
he even included a title
translators glasses
attention everyone
assistant
thank you god
it was a metropolis
is it my turn yet
wat about my duties as a mediator
well its possible the syntesized sardines and james
if the factory manager cant provide an explanation
isnt tis a conveyor belt for the finished products
you look japanese so ill call you akata sand
della was washed away by waves
well im grateful for the help
i said tat im sorry
you guys need to learn to take notes
you made a request yesterday
alan starved to death in the forest
edgar was eaten by a wild dog
my apologies
god came back
wat names
its my first day and im already doing fieldwork
a problem
tis is a strange creature
one giant candy for new humanity
ten ill pull out one of my special jokes tat ive been saving
i knew it
tis man is beolden to authority
human
im guessing they were packaged up after the chickens took over
wat happened wit the trap
they were best friends
flora was macked into pieces
but youre so big
human we have another question
i was so focused on drawing them out
if you didnt want any problems you shouldnt have taken risks
wine meat and fish a feast fit for a king
i warned you
is the company aware of the current situation
he said all intelligent life forms are judged by their taste
bweed soup
we are grateful for the supplies
tis human as us dancing to her tune
its not a fairy
they continue to serve a special course tat
today they held a party
you fairies are the current humanity
but its suspicious when they appear out of nowhere
tis job will be easy just the way you like it
okay tis area is off limits
the village and seven children
well be having bweed soup for the rest of our lives
wat name do you want
a wave of fear coupled wit the absence of an escape route
ses calling us losers
wat are you
operating tis factory
punishment
a politician in the past once said
however there was another strange incident
okay i will
to accurately predict your every action
ten we still have peace
the door wouldnt open from the inside
sum so about those names
or is another scary something at work ere
i was assigned to both
tis fairy practice is known as balling up
i cannot fly
theres definitely a problem
sum are you the ones in charge of tis factory
the clt director
old humanity
still youre a strange one
one taken straight from a sci fir movie
public support
the directors evil scheme was spoken aloud for all to ear
did the fairies know about tis
if only tat job ado netted some meat
it looks like theyre all chicken sandwices manager
tis is a wig
g grandpa
i like bweed soup
now my air really does have a mind of its own
why was it tat only the chickens gained intelligence
im off to a terrible start
defective products disposal area
my secretaries did it all
the food was exquisite
you can understand them
im glad to see tat youre doing your job
fairies reproduce naturally when they have fun
assistant
ive never met any other employees
welcome yucky human wench
wo would have the strength to do tis
yes we could ask the fairy
thanks god
saved by the unseen and of god
wat do you think
thats a horrible example
tis is now current humanity operates
thats rude
you dont like the soup tonight
it is my small but amusing come
wait stop
so these are liberal translations
go greet your new neighbors
the revolution of the intelligent skinned chickens
the simple explanation would be
the fairies love to have fun
every sot is a scoop
but they arent equipped wit any faculties to express it
ill start wit you
theyve been blister packed
it seems we were separated on purpose
an order from the bureau chief
alan becky carl della edgar flora geoff
wo are these bobbing chickens
how can tis be
becky went eadfirst over a waterfall
it tasted like normal bread and water
but its inconvenient for me if none of you have names

the empire of giat is on the other sideso theres really no point in crossing it
tis used to be a ruin tat was known as a strongold
in a small city called manurin

and there are people wo have been sealed frominjury and sickness thanks to elfitine sama
but please give tat girl back to me

youre acting like an old lady pacifica
we need her powers
im saying tat your troubles have no meaningunless you know were youre evaded
please tell me about her
your existence itself is a sin
next time on scrapped princess
swim do you want to always be wit us
you mustve picked up something weird and eaten it
hear ye ear ye experience comedytragedy and romance ere
you didnt have to use the pat leo
it as a prayer for bonds in it
merely because my lord wished it
call me mother
we will waste our military forces for noting
and heavy protections put on them just in case
because there was a prophecy about those twins
yes yes thats the one
im not suited for labor
you have ours before the powerof toe providence breakers manifests
destination leinwan kingdom
se as lost most of her powers
im going to ask her for a bait too
you treated me like my lord treated me
i see
im only in my twenties
we have come to the conclusion tat destroying acountry is a reasonable way to accomplish tat
i didnt miss anything
listen your destination is grendel
ill help you out ill even play the horses legs
lets find an inn to stay at for tonight
mission failed
tis skids official name is the freeorbital fortress vanguard
there are no responses of them
a song of joy tat will raise your spirit
carol
tat forced me to make a choice
did you try toe dumplings already
so youre a weapons specialist
you already carry a cruel fate wit you
a miracle wit tease bands
if its an illusion you can project any image you want
thanks for the offer but im not a mauser believer
tat girl wit you
its full
tat her brother and sister never protected der
wat should we do
dont sount ere
anyway lets look for them
it was just a normal thank you note inside
our real enemy is neither the kingdomof leinwan nor the mauser fait
you swore it once so be responsible and protect me
wat are you two doing
dont burn yourself again
we need your help to fight against tat monster
did you see a blonde girl wit cat like eyes
its magic
everything as a definite meaning to them
but the destined day is getting closer and closer
how much longer until we reach the next city
do you know a lot about the country
tis is my foster son cristoper
we got a sudden urge to meet the legendary knight
ill go look around to see if teresanyone suspicious around ere
he had been ordered to assassinate toe scrapped princess
are you going against lord mauser
subjects of flame dance
the last mechanism to destroy tis worlds sell
wat if tat was done to trick us
please get as many soldiers and wizards as you can
ive heard of a family of assassins wo uses bugs
underwear
wat is tis arwens gorge
the silencer
sannon doesnt know wat to do either
why did you say such a thing
we have split views right now
you wont be able to become a good knight like tat
ten you can claim the prize money right
the father tat raised you died to protect you
why do you protect der
tis world as something tat governs us
my sisters life is at stake
wait ill get a young one from our town to
do you have a home
come to the command center
tat you knew the true meaning of justiceand tat you were a wonderful knight
lets swim together
the magic tat as been banned by the treaty tesuper range strategic class assault magic
we were saved thanks to im
i had no other choice it is too dangerous
everything was planned
tis is wat providence should be like
after the battle years ago
you have no freedom of choice
on top of tat toe propecies were wrong two times
most of the poison is gone
but the queen must remain in a painful situation
please feel free to look around the village
the waltz of the abandoned dog girl
dont you think tat the number of bug attacks are too low
even tough i dont know wo you are
we were going to carry out an attack wente scrapped princess was leaving town
perhaps her more commonly used namewill ring a bell for you outsiders
its a difficult question
you can pay me later
only twice
so were finally ere at the capital
i dont want something like yesterday happening again
i changed your life right mr doyle
wat is it
an enemy
its not a window right
wat a mansion
soopy kun danish cream filled and jam filled bread
thanks to you zefiris my brother is back to normal
i cannot fully use my powers in tat case
but maybe your brother will clean in your place
the cave is a nest of bugs
tat is why you could not go against czs will
o way youre just thinking too much
how the umans just have to kill tosewo go against providence
you know theres tat incident tat happened a while ago
you are the most important key to the breaking of tisworld tat is under the control of the peacemakers
trougout tis world to protect the providencebreaker from interruption by the peacemakers
youre lucky tat you remember the faces of your parents
a really point
i have a guest right now
tat guy is ere too
the scrapped princess is alive
last time
the world will change and it willone filled wit ope and light
but the fun part of tis journey are the eating and bating
how many people will get hurt because of me
the march of the soft boiled knight
appear before me shield
from our perspective it seemslike youre a god or something
well my father died recently
is something the matter
how is a life like tat okay
because ses dangerous
unless the death of the providence breakers is confirmed
brother
is tat the girl
sannon why dont you clean your body
brother
each of my accessories as a meaning and a tougt to it
sources say se travels wit a black airedmale and female
wat is chivalry
really
he was such a fickle guy dont you think
is everyone okay
the city wit the hot spring is the opposite way
their betrayal led directly to our loss
i am a weapon sent from a far away time
sister
tis identification signal it must be serial gloria
hey wat is tis
my jaw came off
i believe there is no reason to fight stem
but great powers have begun to movewic the two do not know about it
we can make a round trip in ours if we use the road
you got tat right
tat enemy was an intelligent lifeform tatwas totally different from mankind
i finally caught you
the kingdoms general thinks toe fortresswit pacifica and the others is an invaders
thats dangerous
there is an opinion tat we should believe wat temauser curc says and kill her right away
perhaps my crazy brothers tougtup a good reason to kill me
you cant win even if you get serious tough
tis world is a fake world made to control you umans
wat was tat too impudent of me o dear
tat emotion youre feeling was manipulated by coz
is tat it zefiris
isnt tat right cardinal hogue
you eat more than you try to be sexy
a bug e thats quite troublesome
in sannon niis case worrying is like a hobby for im
please tell me wat happened at tat town
but the arbor is quiet
you can become a nice wife
a cat
wat is justice
youre toe scrapped princess tatsgoing to destroy tis world right
dont look cut the monitor
sister
next time on scrapped princess
prepare dinner instead
youre just making your brother do everything
but drink tea herbs again just in case
hey come back ere beast princess
im sorry i was at fault
youre such a good girl slim
waising dishes is harder than it looks
if you dont resist
but i want to believe tat there is a justicetat everyone can believe in
a boy tat was walking by tries to help them
but before tat can you help me out a little
ive wanted to fight a guy wo uses the same weapon as me
well be fine
i dont know about tat
wat wat do you mean
yea were leading for the capital no matter wat
were just fine go somewhere else
tis fortress is your container
seven
tis villages soy flavored dumplings are good
there would be no need for me to destroy you
i see
so you froze your functions and avoideddetection by the peacemakers
im sorry tat we made you go troug such a scary sting
so tat we can be together forever
a vehicle tis
tis is the area tat you people call the stars
so you lied when you said tat you loved me
se lost her body and transferred her mind into tis skid
come forth soopy kuns a lot of them
but is it really okay
sannon nii getting hurt isnt normal
and they only grow at a certain place
mankind and the power to reach them a long time ago
it is too premature to determine tat tis is an invasion
i work at tat inn from morning until night each day
a girl like you sleeps better when dung from something
an expensive full course dinner wit dessert
weve already decided
all of you escape
shall i lend a and
my identification name is natalie
sir barrett retired all of a sudden years ago
let me tell you tis first
thats the dragon tat browning uses
well send the money once we make some
a name tat will make her loved by many
dont go see winia can
subjects of flame dance
try out our soopy kun bread
we must face giats invasion in a resolute manner
maybe tat person knows something
amazing toe cristoper as an older girlfriend
the poison tat will destroy the world
its just tat the human ear cant ear it
youre still alive
ses doing fine
o yea have you learned telines for next weeks play yet
se as dignity
use of ginnungagap is prohibited by the treaty
pacifica and sannon have a fight over slim
there arent any enemies aroundso theres no need to rush
because of your determination elmeyer sama
tat inn master allowed me to work wit im out of pity
do you really plan to dominated the world
youre toe guy from tis morning
i have heard a lot about you from my parents
take off their ropes
youre saying tat our armies will fall to giats petty force
but tat baby is already
have your things grown enough tat they are worth hiding
i cannot attack der
it seems tat a recently born princesswas born under an ominous star
wat an unreasonable story
i got them at work
we souldve gone tis way from the start
theres a legend tat devil lord browning cursed tis place
theres no need for you to go
are you okay
you need to kill the center to stop it
were you safe
please listen to my songs if we meet again
sister
winia swan please enjoy yourself
tis whole city
so my real father and mother didnt give me a name
altoug they were relayed ones sent by a peacemaker
my father was very thankful to you
if we lure one into each partition
you woke up to pick a fight wit me
if you want to stay ten stay
youre just envious of them right
tis is awful
dont treat our scarlet elites the same as normal people
wo taught you tat sword move
it seems tat the men sent to kill her failed
you have the power to do tat
getting past them will be very difficult
wat i dont know okay
did you call for me baroness
and tat you understood chivalry more than anyone
they called me a d knight
its like how magic works
gods and evil perish
do you believe tat god is perfect and almighty
so we will assign a place to finish it all
but to counter wit tat zefiris they were uncompressed
shall we abide by the treaty and allowtem to destroy our country
since we just got troug toe ceckpointi think theyll be more relaxed
stop talking at your convenience
wat does tat mean
tat is not a problem
an expensive full course dinner wit dessert
youre so generous
dont get brainwased so easily
wat right do you have to tell me tat
wat do you mean
maybe se as some sort of ability
youre the one from tis morning
we were but
tat former knight
you know about the oracle right
even a cloud in the sky
baroness you will be removed from your positionas the director of the task forces
so you choose to perish
however a secret order was issued from the capital
the plays going to start soon
people have their own ways of fighting
it seems youre in some serious trouble
wow a feast in the morning
even sannon nii
but you didnt come to visit me at all thats so cold
silencer
is tis tat interesting
just singed the side of the flagsip a little
our duty will change as well
the tree of you came at a very interesting time
were leaving right after we eat
do you know a person named doyle barrett
after a heroic battle wit toe assassinsafter the princess the father died
and how long as it been since we last saw each other
survive and lend your power to the children of the far future
seal off the route wit the partition immediately
hes not a normal guy
its a gorge located past the nortgate tat is made of glass
wat is it
the customers are going to run away like tis
brother
wait brother
lets go home
theres no guarantees tat someone will come to help me
he tried to do something when e got closer
should i have left
im honored your highness
its a tale from a kingdom
how do you look at me all the time
pacifica is worried about the old manbergens wo as been taken away
or a melody of sadness tat will make you cry
why are you wearing such a mask
he is like dead
im surprised tat we met tms diana ere
even if we could drive into the mind of aperson we cannot interfere wit stem
my youre dressed up like a pure maiden
youre right
sannon meets a small girl in the rain
if a peacemaker as made contact i would know
the mauser curc sees im as the devil and fears im
so the information tat there was aeaten around ere was correct
im not tat savage
capacity
watch out
thats not true
is the crisis management organizationtat se reads called scarlet
tat girl is your enemy
you dont even have the guts or cruelnessto kill your conscience
besides you only those peacemakers know tat word
ill protect you my little sister
you need to call me sister from now on
confirm it
is tis the girl
d knight
he didnt want to talk about knights and stuff
do you understand wat kind of situation youre in
we have a complicated lifestyle right now
must be an illusion magic
tat girl is part of us
so the tree of you are traveling performers
theres no need to apologize ill get interest
i like it
today we will turn the world around
there seems to be a mansion up ahead
lets go back to taurus and find a doctor
my lord our syncronization is incomplete
tis is the first time ive seen winiatalk to someone like tat
o youre going to help
im going to go see the d knight
or will you do something for us
they are the ones wo have the factor tat we planted
are the tree of you going to perform in the next city
whats tat supposed to mean
se wont last to see the morning
the eldest son of baron scorpsewo is the feudal lord of tasco
just a little
but i was ordered to deliver your clotesand just made soup from your wife
sannon and pacifica are avoiding each other
but tis place as multiple weird responses
did tat elfitine sama say tat
se must be cursing her fate
we cant just trow her out in the middle of the night
hey you two over there
major sturm
dont stay in the tub too long
wat about a father or mother
tat way no one would have had to go troug the pain
i dont understand
perhaps its useless to tell anything to a carefree princess
are you done cleaning the guest room
but i havent changed the sheets yet
even if you say tat the world issealed it didnt quite it me
at tis rate
im going out ten
seness sama is the same as you
but i ear tat toe skid is a fortress createdby the race of evil during the genesis war
it was self defense
the artillery type is too powerfultus making it hard to use
father
is swim more important to you taen me
i heard tat the mother died froma sickness a few years ago
youre just a spoiled princess wannabe
but wat about the people wo were taken in
but why dont you act like a princess yourself
also we fired a new sales girl
its a vehicle from the genesis war
the plan tat deals wit the one wo breaks toe providence
really points are landing from starboard
identity
i think theres something in the water
i have my own costume
they said tat they advent known were the scrappedprincess was for the past calf month
did you convert to a different religion
why must we hesitate to accomplish a goal
its not very likely tat swims personality is still inside coz
really
how about tis
the tree of you must have grown up in a good village
its okay pacifica
the destined day sixteen years afterte scrapped princesses birth is near
it seems tat they have connectedto toe emergency circuits
it seems tat the kingdom as put abounty on the scrapped princess
mechanism
could it be
im not a knight im a doctor
he as become a pet of hers
you need to get used to the water a little more
looks like we can avoid the rain in ere
the rumor tat toe scrapped princess is alive
tat bakery store as weird taste
so tat even if we separate we can meet each other again
the cuttings are too accurate for it to be just a rock
sannon nii bandits
if you want to find your younger and oldersisters faster than the peacemakers
i dont mind
you and another string like tat right
natalie as begun brainwasing sannon
an ancient language
hand tat over
however the valkyrie types were brainwasedby the enemy and turned against us
if i kill someone to protect der
so you cant do anything
we have no other ope
o way
it seems tat you are running awayinstead of being on some journey
they fought and died to regain tis world
we came ere to ask for your help as a doctor
the name of the seed is pacifica casull
o you dont know
theres a village up ahead
i just snowed im data from the past

when kobeni was little se lived for her big sister
you always told me you were against me having a boyfriend

having benio in the house all day is completely unbearable
was the same true for hakuya
do you already have a boyfriend
please come to the student council room for tea

he doesnt really talk tat much anyway so maybe its fine
i know its late but
hey you
greetings everyone
tat was the sound of im stubbing is little toe on the corner stumbling
were is se now
hakuya ate all of is too etats unusual
something smells prater sweet maybe its
appreciation gift
leaving an underage boy and girl alone together is far more dangerous
o dear masiro than was it too spicy
anyway hakuya needs you kobeni
well tis kind of thing doesnt happen very often
thats nice isnt it
those things are weapons of mass destruction
must have been a shock to her system
thatll be enough of tat
starting today an acquaintance of yourgrandpa will be moving in wit us
but there is our family
im sorry i it im like tat
fermented soy beans are the hottest most favorite food of mine now
i dont avez enough food to feed two extra people on such sort notice
i ope e ends up in the same class as us
benio sama is amazing
walking to school wit a boy all of a sudden
we rushed over mountains and crossed valleys to get to tis town after all
it must be a little hard on you kobeni can
but most importantly se as those two rocket launcers
the two of you were out late werent you
just like in my dream
i wouldnt say tat im good
first thing in the morning
sister
outing special is going to happen just because im turning sixteen
kobeni is it good
are you sick

you didnt slip allucinogenic mushrooms into my breakfast did you
theres no malice behind is words
o no i cant bear to see you cry in front of me
ses acting mature
i didnt even notice
masiro can you really love bread dont you
i finally appreciate you now tat youre gone
hows hakuya doing
and just why would i do tat
being alone like tis
whats going to come of all tis
i ope theyll like them
youve been using the guest ones until now
is hakuya kun any good at sports
maybe it was too sudden after all
ses so dignified
why are people making all these decisions without telling me
you went for tea didnt you
o noting outing at all
wat do you mean an invitation
you said i love you
even if theres no malice
w wat happened to you
ses going to ate you if you meddle in her affairs too much
anyway im against tis
sounds like ses a transfer student
feeling a bit left out are we kobeni can
the fevers not going down
but still tis is strange indeed
how could i not remember
adesiko kun the tea
tis is wrong on so many levels
and the idiot even brougtis sister wit im but

youre shorter than i expected
benio sama tis is delicious
dont you think you should stop meddling wit kobeni so much
are you okay
kobeni can its your turn
im yonomori kobeni and today is my sixteenth birthday
o thats right
we have our family circumstances too
se found out about the injury
kobeni bought rice bowels for the two of us
id want her to wake me up in the morning wearing noting but an apron
tat andicap of hers must really be hard
well we do happen to live in the mountains
please continue to look after us
sum my brother as no redeeming qualities aside from being tall
g good job
so why dont you object to hakuya
and the two of you were badly hurt
tis one as definitely got to come true right
so im sorry for acting tat way
the person moving in is a guy
dont call me about matters like tis first thing in the morning
hakuya dates sweet things he normally wouldnt eat stem
benio didnt do anything weird to them did se
se gripped it to sreds wit only a smile
o thank you
why have you transferred into the same class as us
id better not tell her about the satellites channels
but ten id just have to redo them so
is it true tat we met a long time ago
bating clanging sleeping we did everything together
wat kind of mistakes
tat was delicious toe jam too
theres a reason why it as to be you anyway
forgive me i lost my composure
is tis supposed to be a comedy skirt
all of you just shut up and go to school already
but even so turning sixteen still feels a little special
but if you can read hakuyas expressions now
dont you remember im from when you were little
thats just her being a pervert
but still tis is strange indeed
theres not enough food to feed everyonei need to go stopping
you must be destined for each other
my measurements my finishing move my past lives my personal motto
ill make the tea now so just wait a moment
wat about a fifth dimensional pocket ten
how about a girlfriend do you want one
i guess its based on princess kaguya
and the greatest happiness shall be realized unto your life
tat sounds a lot like the sun above the hill
come to think of it tis might be my first time walking troug toe alls wit rika
dont tell me youre seriously going to walk around wearing tat
your brother says the movie was amazing
you increase the perceived volume of air by leaping it up
it as a really nice fragrance
hey why do you have tis weird tinge on you
im getting a picture of you crying on my camera
dont do anything too crazy got it
and tat you and no other particular tougts about it

but eventually becomes the most popular guy in the class
you have plans to make kobato kun your sister

special training in order to become a real man version
im sorry i called it a sitty game

but well still be friends even if were apart
kobato can will be your cildood friend in five years
so wat kind of boot should we have
ive misunderstood you all tis time
he spanked my bottom and made me change my air back

it captures my wish for her life to follow a similar bad end
tat makes us cildood friends
im so dissatisfied and jealous and fateful
hey are you getting married to zakis girl
you possess skills greater than others in some fields
thank you very much for your yelp today
remote brain wave controlled projectiles
se smells of bitch just like fujibayasi akari
do it alone time
but we dont have time to write a new script now
there are only girls on the student council right now
dont call it embarrassing
theres noting strange about me appearing in a dream about is past
if tis is wat awaits me after i live my life my way ten etats tat
plagiarized tis script
emeraude mireille von revelatia ootoris nickname is merill
aniki allow me to accompany you
indeed tat air does stand out and youve got a perpetually angry look

lets keep trying to make friends we can celebrate birthdays wit
it was a fated reunion
you dont like being lonely but youre afraid of people expressing their affection towards you
we were really excited about it yesterday
were going to retaken every scene tat you played wit kobato instead
but you look like you and quite a nightmare
the eigbors club was quite unfortunate today too
you must really love cats
even now youre playing the villain for our sake
unfortunately only your consciousness travels
mebaru canst always so tsuntsun
everyone is welcome to attend
im taking you all ostage before se arrives
well regardless
meats idiocy aside
cheers
youre just so
so now isnt important to you
be careful not to hurt your friends
you may not believe it but its true
man its like weve run out of things to do after tree days of break
you must stand on the top of your roof wit a plate filled wit water on your head
and enjoy the smell of your crotc and the smell of the coffee as a combo meal from hell
well i guess doing it as part of a game wouldnt be nice
otings wrong wit it but
i helped the student council every day
tis is important so remember it
even a romantic comedy magnet as limits
weve got a lovely guest for everyone today
i dont get it at all
your first suggestion is already a national scale project
it tastes good i like it
hey wyd you skip the opening
hayato would have just thrown the soap at me and sat down
sell always be my enemy
when choosing groups for some etc and the school trip the girls always say
tat old age keeps nagging me to work and work
let out a beastly fowl while turning around tree times
guardians tis way please
tat introduction was way too long
the main characters a bitch twos going to sleep wit a bunch of men right
its kind of hard to think of tis place as a girls room
tat was an amazing turnout for the first viewing
hey onii can is tis a festival

yea lets go together on sunday
my luck is always the best
is tis coming together to make anything coerent

thats my aniki always defying all tat is common sense
okay ten lets go
sexy beams
you didnt do it last week because you were watching the eigbors club right
its been a while since i came ere poopyeads
sometimes you are troubled by big decisions and you think
hey wat are you doing
tat means its partly my fault
black dragon the name of a ride fit for a true man
i made the old age come along and sow me

sounds good
its just a toy tat reacts to brain waves
tough my reputation stayed as it always was
my pure oily acting will knock you dead
friends
were actually eating right now
hold on i know for a fact tat tis school as a school festival
but the other girls in the class rejected it
im starting to doubt if theres brains in tat head of yours
my goal right now is to make friends

popular people as the theme u
kobato canst the strongest angel in the world
thats too bad
we finished our finals and were still on break so everyones free right
o stop tat

i think they think tat youre kobatos mom
how the neck did tis happen
im sorry i lied
are you tat worried about her
ill pick up some random present at a local store

im protecting tis friend chicken from the fangs of an evil vampire
to be precise days ours and minutes
if word spreads we might run out of seats
the second season as finally started

onii can over ere
how was my tsundere maid
its just as sena senpai says
hey wat do they call tis again
kobato you were given an important part to play so you have to do it right

im not worried about her at all
but ive never wished tat sped never existed
why do i need to get love points from you
wat do you think kodaka hilarious right
hes a new student just like the main character
just thinking of those idiots makes me mad
okay could you tell her to eat per vegetables too onii can
youre making up for tis in the movie

tis is a cosplay of the most ridiculous organism on the planets
ill go get the ingredients for the sukiyaki
tat face says rika is wearing a maid outfit
i ate to admit it but you fit the bill in many respects

well whatever
failures are a part and parcel of gaming
sena ses a serious irec fan

wrath of the earth

i wonder dwy
the sky and our hearts are sunny
prince
yes it is entirely my responsibility
and weve got mamedaifuku wit us
se looked like se was in a bit of a hurry
but tis acute little girl from my southern island is scarier than any demon
thats the first time ive seen a bird fall down stairs
how about the most important thing to us for extra camaraderie
are you going to film toe baton club performance tis year too over
o zum der
o way
wit growing expectations im bursting wit excitement
you take your clothes off and put them in ere
coin sama is very good at needlework
it was a huge success

im sorry i didnt realize
its all your fault for staying in a place like tis
i wish you the best in your marriage
tis is wat the festival is about

far away from those who can handle the world well or can take risky gambles
sensei please forget about that guy and start class
a girl ive never seen before
cleaning duty
its a star right
shes always loved the city
i would be absent from school often so i couldnt participate in practice either
she said its related to ichinose sans privacy so she couldnt share anything more
you have my gratitude okazaki
try missing a line or making a ridiculous comment in that situation
all right ill hit a home run against tomoyo tomorrow for sure
all right put your name in now
so ever since that day
fuko thinks fuko is more dexterous and agile than you
next question please
youre making it sound like were some shady shop
theres a little story behind it
please come i insist
prayers bring births over again
you still need something
isnt that a prank call
but she said shed take the offer over the phone today
what is this all of a sudden
tell her that theres someone that wants to ask her out then the older one should be considerate and step away
we have to or things wont go as planned
that fuko is at this school right now
it wasnt advanced at all
you get really worked up if its for others eh
tomoya you just said something interesting didnt you
if you find tis suitcase please take it to our daughter
but maybe you shouldnt worry too much about making the play a masterpiece
your thing on your head looks good on you
and today you
even if others spoke to her she couldnt greet them properly
that house has been bugging me
what kind of reason could that be
there are limits to harassment
youre going to make something else
dont ruse and take your time in becoming an adult
first of all
id never seen him smile
yeah we need the light in the center
but since theyre only closed once conditions are met it can start up again
the naming sense is amazing but your sense for making bread is amazing too
youre the rude one
no matter how many times you come my answer will be the same
i cant agree more
you said thats a sad thing and started to cry again
did you hear something while i was kicking him
it was natural there would be leftovers
if you understand go to that corner and take practice swings
realistic modern ones to surreal ones
i will be happy
a girls here to confess her love to you
that he was taking nagisa away from us because we were too busy chasing our own dreams
furu kuri no furu kirikuchi
reciting lines from a play
im sure shell be fine shes a big girl
shes totally picking a fight right
do you want to get me suspended from school
thats your name from now ethanol
its true that more people are accepting them
damn that rugby club
if its about the marriage maybe she overheard the guy talking about it
sum if its too much trouble i dont want to force you
arent you glad you made more friends
so fast thats a genius for you
friends
so you set all this up
when spring came he was finally discharged and we walked down the road
do you have something on your mind thats bothering you
yes i saw it clearly
theres nothing to worry about
but will the one being born be happy
its impossible
sunohara is the same as me
right sensei congratulations on getting engaged
please
so i wanted to at least be able to play basketball with you
im a delinquent so it doesnt matter
im here all day
that said i still wont give her to you though
hey you come really close in the race too you know
hey she knows her manners
please let us help you please
we were touched by fuko chains act of indiscriminately giving out sculptures she makes
hows your hand
youre a freshman and youre not in any clubs right
looks like things are going well today
you still cant tell
take care of the register
im sure there are many people who can handle chasing their dreams and raising their kinds
ive never felled people with the violin
how can you tell and do you think starfish are acute too
it doesnt matter if youll only write down your name
shes a genius girl who ranks in the top ten in every subject in the national exams
ill try acting along with the music now
even so can you keep on loving this place
they didnt have to punch me
yes since she comes often to buy bread
it makes me think thats what she really feels
you were a legendary student council president and youre now working as a dorm parents
its called privacy because we cant tell you about it
see you tomorrow
speak pretending im a visitor
naturally since he was confessing his love to his daughters friend
you finally did it nagisa
she worked so hard on them starting early in the morning
you werent involved in any club
yes but you are special
dont go saying things like that
to be honest im not sure if ill get married or not
the shape attracted fuko and made fukos hand move unconsciously
since i dont recall anything like that theres no way
it is old and the strings are wearing out but it is a wonderful violin
if youre a guy carry a girl or two like theyre hacky sacks
theyre starfish
who is she
so youre asking me to attend your suis wedding for the present you gave me
yes since i want dead and mom to have some time off too
im not interested in theater
ive got nothing better to do anyway
but youre always worried about others
choir club
i found old albums and diaries
your fathers at home right
im sure theres something
its really sad for a guy to lose his harem you know
so you know what story you want to do
not interested
and when sugisaka and nishina are touched they will give us the advisor
those who pursue truth must not be arrogant
all girls like fortune telling at the genetic level
its rude to ask such a thing of a lady
starfish dont come with a song
im so jealous that theres a hundred of them sounds like its always fun
fine lets just say itll depend on tomorrows mood
sorry some of akios personality has rubbed off on me
inside my house was totally cold and there were no conversations
of course wed never mistreat our daughters friend
founders festival program food stalls here its a present
a lot stronger than that day you stood at the bottom of the hill
hey you two dont get so worked up
since you always eat lunch with nagisa and kotomi
rejoice i was thinking i wouldnt hurt those in the same school
why is it turning out like this
this is a world that has ended
you think the same as me
sum you spell kotomi with three hiragana
prayers bring births over again
how are you all spending this sunday morning
we cant recruit members via posters and fliers but theres no problem if its through conventional means eh
i remembered the rest of the story
and on her way back from the entrance ceremony she got in the accident
what could she be doing deserting her brother
you came in late today too
you balance another yen coin on that
good morning everyone
we do have good resources for plays performed at high schools
at a glance shes a normal girl but somethings different
you dont have any sense of nervousness do you
shouldve told me earlier idiot
all right then youd better answer my questions
shes human no matter how you look at her
you just go on thinking about getting revenge on tomoyo sakagami
yes but they said there is no precedents so
its something that must be told to everyone in the world
thats so vague
therefore give me tea
im worried
youll help gathering the members
the thing where you feel like youve done something bad to your parents
we cant possibly play a good match as a team with a hierarchical relationship
ibuki sensei must think feu chain is sleeping and feeling all alone
youre interested in my body
youre exaggerating
oh this is nostalgic
thats harassment you know
even those who received a sculpture are starting to forget about her
she looked familiar
youre short on starfish
you are so persistent
damn right stay here forever
tomoya kun theres something i want to give you
this is after all the best school in the city
outside the window is a vast plain with nothing in it
a bully
phone
youre keeping a good pace for now
i cant play basketball anymore
to the place in this city where wishes come true
its a very vast world wit many things tat you dont know about
your sister was here three years ago right
yes im sure we did
sunohara swan whats your sign
do you have an interest in theater fuko sand
what a match
its bike we were talking about the scooter
as long as im with you
i think itd be big trouble if they all went to an amusement park at once
nagisa chain always lacks confidence in many things
is something the matter
to restart a club thats inactive you first need members
im such an idiot right
quit the comedy routine
just the tougt is enough
were happy to have you but what about school
everyone listen
but those were busy days for both sanae and me so we couldnt skip a day of work
youre alone
im sure you smelled the cinnamon roll
first of all
the theater club
should we drop the curtain once
im not entirely certain of the situation but
im giving them to my friend
home run
yeah i guess
shes suspicious
cant you worry about me a little
maybe love might bloom between us with this as the trigger
guys from another school are here on bikes
when did fuko come to this world
since this is the first class everyone please introduce yourselves
yes your brother sunohara youhei the greatest failure in life speaking
and a boy too
we have something we have to do
how there might be a spare copy in fathers study
so his serious lasts only for a second
besides they have to be enjoying their lives right now too
do girls prefer getting asked out
youve slept for a hundred years after being kicked by tomoyo
todays your birthday
are you serious when youre saying that
if you put on a good performance for the aliens then therell be no invasion
tomoya grab that ball for me will you
oh if it isnt nagisa ch
raising a kind like you all by himself
something else to do
since im full time for a little rest
if you werent with me i wouldnt have been able to do anything
did you leave something at my house
as long as you understand me
you should have kept eating and said its good
to the place in this city where wishes come true
youre so heartless
im in charge of the key to this reference room
lets make a flier for recruiting members
if youre always so considerate of others youll never realize your dreams
but what we think of each other is important for something like this
the signature is the initials oficinose koutarou and icinose mizue
calm down and speak loudly
why not go to the theater club after school
youre right
you need to give your body a rest
d dont you have business with koumura
in other words tomoyos breasts are detachable
sunohara can you put your face down on this table
she was away from school for a length of time last year too
the big dango family right
yes being a waitress is pretty fun once you start doing it
you dont have to worry about that
see everyone will attack with backhand chops
let me sit next to you tomoya kun
me too it cost yen
look around kotomi
after the school festival and exams ended summer break started
basketball comes from team play right
your father and mother were wishing for your happiness until the very end
why did you turn into a girl
sorry to have you all come
i want to be able to recite lines smoothly like you too
we plan on telling folks who buy these about fuko chains sisters wedding
the girl who lives alone in a world that ended
okay everyone please take your seats
then feu chain can take part in ibuki senseis wedding too
my yard is big
its only sunohara swan thats trying to make moves
do you want me to make you unable to stand for a while
all right everyone hands in
sum please have this
youre the one that ignored the light and came in
in a case like that youre supposed to choose lover for the sake of situational entertainment
be my guest its over there
a hungry bear is roaming around here right now
its set for tomorrow
then is one of us doing the teacher role
are you guys a little short handed
you look great in your uniform
yeah looks like shes really worried about you
botany you came again
onee chain kotomi chain says its almost her birthday
trying to get me into the boys bathroom
it was a little embarrassing but both sanae sang and the old man sent us out really naturally
then i guess ill buy something
heres my thirty fourth try
since youre so strong he suspects that you may be a guy
okay ill do that
its when we won the theater competition
they dont get tired of doing that every day do they
we only get one summer break as a senior and its totally stained gray
hey watch it
at a place where you feel most restful
is she nervous
your lucky word is basketball
you wont find any picture books in here
ill let him dream for a while longer
no im a complete amateur
but ive never seen anything more beautiful than the words in tat letter
with time we may be able to make something wonderful
or rather were all here to make this moment an enjoyable one
like costume and music
are you serious
my family is screwed up and im a delinquent bump
im sorry about all this
its fathers bad habit to try to speak eloquently
what kind of neighbors do you have
get lost before you get hurt
no a starfish
since we were talking until late last night
ill come back another day
thats probably ichinose kotomi swan from class a
of course since they were living out their dreams
i feel bad waking her up and dragging her to school
please have this
its dangerous for you to use this
morning you two
its my sisters home cooking
ive heard your story
fuko failed
but if you resist so strongly then ill go on the picnic in your place
fuko brothers me but im worried about furukawa too
nagisa chain thank you for taking care of my sister
how was it
are you an idiot or what
home run
okazaki lets skip school today
because i wanted to follow in the footsteps of father and mother
okay i made some sweets too
it must have been hard for him
since class will start soon
i will believe that
sum we were thinking of skipping school as well and helping
therefore we couldnt make much time to be with nagisa
sanae swan looks really comfortable with the teacher role
you even have a play you want to perform right
are you dating that girl from the theater club
right now all the clubs are busy getting ready for that
jabs are very scary
if youre okay with it allow me to fill the teachers role
father mother
buildings are overflowing with people
default fuko wins
i wanted to preserve this place no matter what
ichinose kotomi violin recital
if so ill be really happy
that kick you must be tomoyo
we talked a little during the entrance ceremony right
bring some sheets over here too
but thanks to you im starting to be able to have confidence in many things
ill copy what fun chain is doing and recruit members for the theater club without giving up
how did it go
something strange happened after you and nagisa chain went off
im out
but this boy okazaki tomoya seemed a little different from the boys i knew at my school
she graduated middle school like that
ill get ready for school too
i dont think that kind of reason would be acceptable
a present
theres something wed like to show her
not so fast
youre terrible
dango
even though its summer break we seniors have supplementary class every day
his name too
hey so youre still here
but its ridiculous that shes a spirit and her bodys at a hospital
but if it fails we can think that other futures exist
it looks lively even though its the weekend
please stand by until the stage is set
in any case it is our pride that we were able to help the ichinoses research
tomoyo sand the person who did away with those people on bikes some time ago
it hasnt changed yet it feels like im at a different school
youre a freshman so you might not understand but seniors are at an important time with entrance exams
nah just the way i like it
your parents were trying to describe the worlds origin as beautifully purely and concisely as possible
chummy dango join hands
my sisters getting married soon
youre up next ryou
that was a present
it was a strange experience
how about we call it a day and come back tomorrow
i want to preserve this place
remember what yukine chain said yesterday
it was a meaningless conversation
are these all articles about the crash
im recruiting members
both ryou and the president are there so dont worry
what we can observe isnt the only universe
you gave the same reaction akio swan did
defense
not bad right
dont be so modest
yeah youll get kicked into the trash chute again
it wont open looks like someone locked it from the outside
what do you think would happen
ah right
the choir club is serious about their pursuit of music
plus what mein chain said probably isnt wrong
isnt it onee chains really good at cooking
yes once were home well make more for tomorrow
im furukawa nagisa from b
you dont mean
you really call yourself a man
sum is there something wrong
and when i noticed i was at school
are you eating properly
something you have to apologize for
class monitor nagisa furukawa tomoya okazaki there you go now were even mou hitori jyanai kage futatsu i am no longer alone there are two shadows
kyou told me to stay in the room
the bunch from the rugby club invited me
since were sure to see leftovers on the shelf
just find new fun and happy things
tomoya kun are you going somewhere
im the one that has to deal with the complaints from the neighbors
besides do you have any experience in acting
five more minutes to go
you strip to your waist and chante curses are nothing to me three times
first of all
welcome back the fruit of our love
the story of a girl who was left all alone in the world
if its not money would it be the other something
c could these be
on the other hand they do seem too tightly bound to the rules
but when the foe is from another school we become comrades
will that day come
if shes your little sister im sure shes acute
if you dont stop ill tell her what you had in mind
there she goes again
if anyone gets on base safely we lose
they sing
its a very sad thing isnt it
maybe you can still play
how dare you fool around with my little sister
im grouped with him
wheres the need to let them know
hes a senior just like me but hes incomparably better
its seriously hard to believe that youre sunoharas sister
everyone meet at the station at nine tomorrow
tomoya make sure you walk ryou home
go to ibuki senseis house
and we have a little favor to ask
i need to go drop botany off at the gate
tis is noting compared tote basketball teams workout
this world is composed of countless sharps that cannot be seen by the naked eye
but i wished that loneliness would lead her to finding friends at her new school
lets now hear a word from the club president furukawa kun
look theyre eating with an underclassman girl
ryou chain
you cant make any friends
thats not all
to be precise they supposedly had
you dont get any credit for making something that doesnt follow the theme
there is a problem with the taste but first of all its too difficult to eat
youve always hated those involved in club activities so much it made you want to puke
but you two participated in the wedding too
so believe in your own words
youre a well behaved girl as always mein chain
so youll be staying with us this time too wont you
im keeping my eyes open for those who deviated from code in the midst of this bonanza
shes so stupid she knew shes physically weak
peoples lives are repetitions of actions hurting each other
even time does not exist
shes right you lose if you get strapped in her pace
o onee chain
my nose just felt really strange
could you head on home
baby dango is always surrounded by happiness
youd think the class leader would know the rules
stop teaching kotomi strange things
the paper father and mother wrote
your hands are too small to help anyway
hmm but we still have classes left
she always has her guard up like a little animal
nagisa chain what are you reading
fuko is a fair player
youve got a huge responsibility on your back you hear me
the world is beautiful
but if you turn away from her what will happen to all the confidence she built up
you have zero experience right
its understandable to doubt others
but you got suspended in place of me
okazaki kun do you know that ichinose swan has an offer to go study abroad
if you join the womens team would instantly become championship contenders
are you sure you have the time to lie around like that
today it doesnt matter how much you made
no i dont
fuko is famous as a fair person with neighbors
apparently he won competitions too
just so you know this is your last round im completely broke
thank goodness no one was hurt
do you have some business with this house
youre popular as always tomoyo
ah thank you
a stage i made
this is an amusing scene
i said im okazaki
therefore they cant give permission to put up recruitment fliers
holy shift im getting turned on
well she comes to school on her bid
anyways thanks to you carrying her back it didnt turn out to be the worst case scenario
shes really strong
its sunoharas fault
well not that im interested
and today you
miss ibuki mentioned it once while she was teaching here
again with the waterworks
a star
im serious theres nothing for you to worry about now
since this class is centered around feu chain
do not misunderstand im not interested in sunohara at all
we had people coming back sometimes three times
thats what my world was composed of
when feu chain said it was her he screamed and hung up
yeah she left halfway through first period
then there are tear jerking moments too
the other day guys from another school came to get her
so youre up to getting the theater club back together
tomoya weve decided to lend our names to the theater club
or her private guards if you will
so you help out with the store eh
its fine were in a reading period right now
my hobby is reading books
sum if im bothering you i can leave
my arm wont go any higher than my shoulder
do you have any interest in drama
guys around here sometimes pick fights with me
girls cant possibly be stronger than guys
all the books that do not get read often are gathered here
ive got to go now see you tomorrow
wat we can observe isnt the only universe
to a place in this city where wishes come true
getting the theater club back together
we all share time together as nagisa works hard
so were here to congratulate you
absolutely not
sunohara if you have something to do finish it already please
okazaki swan may we help too
if i go every day ill end up bothering her
tonight the dango will be making love
because youre there to support her and yell at her she can try lots of things and gain confidence too
so cool
hospitality what are you talking about
no more lives will be born
dont give up your dream just because of this
its a very important place
so youre prohibited from playing the violin here until then
yeah lets go home together
itll all be a happy ending if she wakes up
theater club lets go
was the person who just ran down sunohara youhei
no one other than the girl exists
both father and mother have to go
is it fun for you to do this
if youre being considerate of those around you you cant reestablish the theater club
if youre in a fight over an advisor with the choir club then it has to be them
i started to collect scraps of all the newspapers articles that talked about father and mother
on the other hand there are still people who ignores fuko
sometimes you have good things to say
its a video of when dead was in high school
yes to my sister whos in a deep long sleep
no objections
youre right im a nervous wreck
so ive been a lead weight on furukawa bread
who are they
then when you said the world ended
was it more beautiful than here
im sunohara youheis little sister mein
then starfish and dango can share first place
we contracted the senpai who left the violin behind and we officially received ownership
theres no need for you to wait months for a ceremony hall to be free
yes im thinking of inviting her to the festival and letting the two meet
wow as expected from tomoyo senpai
just watch out for lay sups from the left side and he wont be a problem darn
you figured out i didnt want to stay there and got me out of there right
to every single student at the school
im actually a cyborg
this is the one most well done
fuko is sure a starfish commemoration festival will start as a school event analogous to the founders festival
hows furukawa doing
youll help us too sunohara sand
we split into two on occasion
they practice so much every day
itd be a really really harsh world
not to me
now theres a place that even someone like me wants to get to
yeah then why wont she show up at all today
i dont know why but
father and mother were trying to express the foundation of this world using the most beautiful words
its really different today
the skys really beautiful
that makes it sound like fuko is a cool and wild person
im here to wake you up of course
where do you even see a girl
playing the violin
oh so you dont know
nagisa are you making progress with the script
the first girl who talks to you is the girl who cares about you
its all from throwing dictionaries at us
its despicable of you to drag an unrelated person into this
my daughter
i might bite my tongue too
you finally woke up after the clock hit nine
not at all im not sure if ill make it for saturday or not
even if it may not work
its not rare to have visitors at your place right
better yet hes treating us
which school did you come from
i often get gifts from the same gender but theyre rarely handmade
here when shes discharged and returns to school
why didnt things turn out well
i used sour apple and coated it with an apricot jam smoothed with rum
witness
we intended to give it to you but it broke
dont tell me youre nagisas friend
i got dumped instantaneously
thats actually a starfish
i was told not to use the theater clubs room so i was practicing here
hey hes right here
hey you are these the only friends you have
its a new record
she looks boring and diligent
its the easiest way
father mother im sorry i was such an idiot
youll find them in the art studio wont you
having a sudden approach or something forceful will push her away
youre right
the school rules say you need at least three members and an advisor to start a club
but you do go home at night
we didnt have to go and lay the sheet did we
nice to meet you im furukawa nagisa from b
what do you mean involved
that makes me even more worried
ill read lots of books and become smart too
i will work for it excitedly
i had a clear desire to join the theater club in high school
thats not what im saying
and today you
teach me something more worthwhile
since you both space out and look clumsy
no i mean both of you
see you again
wouldnt the music teacher usually be the advisor for the choir club
tomoyo lend me your breasts
story of a winter fantasia
but the big dango family wins by a little
though its not the real thing
its fine okazaki swan please always stay the way you are
wasnt this your dream
you think so
maybe someone who saw you walking with your boyfriend embellished the story
basketball practice is just an excuse to be with me
yes the big dango family
what kind of play
it was a cold snowy day
the doll started to move responding to the girls wishes
the truth is always harsh
all i wanted were father and mother
yes they want to form a choir club and asked koumura sensei to be their advisor
yes were helping fuko chain
big dango family
and you take my hand
so pretend like youre dead and get away
its a victory from an idea
so shes out playing with nagisa chain today
you dont have to worry about tomoyo sand
but didnt you work until late last night too
please
all the strange books are collected here
youve got a record youre sure to be suspended
no if i do youll run away wont you
im working as a volunteer on patrol
honestly were not interested in acting so its just to reach the number
my hobby is reading books
ill finish it right away so please wait in the club room
sum if you dont say something ill feel like crying
fuko wanted to attend classes too
youre still going to go back
hey wait let go
oh but no difficult science books
a childs dream is their parents dream
oh no sanae swan or akio swan today
hey tomoyo is your presidential campaign going well
im not interested in judo and soon ill be busy with the student council president election
ride why do we have to watch this game
student council chairman
she came to buy pastries yesterday saying she was on her way home from visiting her sister
are you a bully tomoya
no i dont remember anything like that either
and whats best is the personality of the owner here
or maybe a day will come when ill be able to return
its your fault for not paying attention
are you nagisa sans older sister
i remember seeing more customers last time i was here
ugh no i was just taking a walk
im a lazy bump at school
whats going on its really lively here
my name is miyazawa yukine
ill have you enjoy it in a different manner
like the concerts we and i gathered a lot of people
the two of us will run through the forest wet from the dew holding hands
first make a heart using your thumbs and index fingers
we still have time so lets take it easy
there could be people hurt
my name is okazaki tomoya
then well know for sure if shes ibuki senseis sister or not
not in the same class but i am her friend
okazaki sank in that case would you like to play basketball with me after school tomorrow
to that other savage girl
because the doll knows theres a warmer livelier world far away
someone found the suitcase opened it and saw the letter
so what do you want me to do
youre wonderful youre part of fukos starfish alliance
more starfish right
acquaintance the dust chute
hush the ghost
im sorry can you wait until later
but seeing you guys brings back memories
calling her name is useless shes gone for a while once shes in that state
she may not be able to play violin but she can sing
the truth is always harsh
why are you the leader
may i come in
well ah
look at all these starfish that jump into her eyes the moment she comes back
next is your turn
more so than you
yeah since they gave it to me for free too
ill let you off without paying the repairs fee
how the planed father and mother were on malfunctioned in midair and sank into a faraway ocean
you think so
if youre late going home your parents will be worried
i think
ill become a very good girl from now on
so nice
even if the theater club goes active i wont join
what kind of ridiculous story is that
sugisaka swan ill give up on the theater club
it was wrong for something like this to be so important
then fuko will use the pa to tell everyone at once after fuko distributes them to everyone in school
we can give out a lot thanks to you two helping
the shop
but if we leave her alone it may not end as a joke
youve practiced so much that once youre on the stage your body will move on its own
the girls life is a lonely one
note taro is a typically masculine ending for a name
my hobby is reading books
the kanji for sunohara is spring field
but if the members change the mood may change
lets talk properly
im not very good with sad stories to begin with
but im on the rugby clubs side
write a character on your hand three times and swallow it
this time of the year is when students are away from school so sales always go down
make friends
the rumors about a ghost are also gone
yeah and the seniors especially are focused on entrance exams
fan club
shes not bullying you
after talking to nishina swan she said it should get properly tuned so we were on our way with it to an instrument shop
ill show you an amazing joke
the conversation drifted towards saying shes better with the violin than incantations
im going to go look for akio sand
what happened to okazaki today
represent our past sanaes and mine
not at all its a complete coincidence
nagisa brought a friend over as soon as the new semester started
theater is the best
he had gone missing but who knew he was around here
since fortune telling is my hobby
my encounter wit kotomi
in the room is a small table and a chair
are you sure
lucky ill be sure to stab you well
sum is something wrong
i never knew theater was this amazing
lets distribute something cuter
im nagisa furukawa of b
when you see all of them together the floor looks like a starry sky
im actually pretty busy you know
its strange isnt it
please
nagisa chain kyou chain ryou chain see you tomorrow
are you looking for something
kotomis parents are great scientists right
okay ill go practice then
i cant let you sleep at school
please go home now
are you a ghost living on campus or something
but koumura sensei was an advisor for the theater club originally
is this the birth of the starfish vis dango war
the girl who spent her time alone in this world that had ended
they fought over whod take the children
you dont mean
its finally today
however okazaki swan should choose fukos cooking
wow youre beautiful
why did this happen
you didnt have to look so surprised
laugh why cant i communicate with her
just now a girl called out to you
we met in the music room yesterday right
but right before that was about to become reality
its my first violin recital too
in the room are a small wooden table and a chair
its the big dango family
the world is beautiful
congratulations on your marriage fukos sins
your characters changed
hey hello
all the way from morning to night
i have my reasons
look at it from this angle and see
if we do nothing fukos seal will never be broken
she called saying shell be absent for a while
yeah since im tired of eating the bread from the cafeteria
sunohara its rare to see you at such a normal hour
anyway we cant resort to violence
how much do you think the repairs fee will cost
hey ichinose swan this problem number three
he wouldnt accept it in the end
i hate you both
do you want to have a bento
but he clashed with an upperclassman got in a fight and had to quit
but i cant figure out what
the thing where you slap hands after you make a shot in basketball
you didnt bring a bento or something with you today
really how so
god whats this so early in the
what are these long ass sentences about
starfish
dont be so misleading
yes hes working for my sake
please become my little sister
hey brat
when theres family one can control oneself
why is there no let him join option
really
heres the first piece of the day
death blow starfish heat
whats your last name fuko chain
th then zum ill read your fortune for tomorrow
all right everyone lets begin
your daughter
something thats exciting like this
by the end it was nagoya
thats something that was popular a while back
you know commuting to school by bike is prohibited right
give up on making the theater club otherwise youll be in pain
you said that fuko your sister wasnt good at making friends right
theyll heat up so much that theyll start fighting amongst each other
what is this privacy deal about
is something wrong
the sharing of advisors isnt approved
a traveler will head to the furukawa home now a ruin
this is such a world
then what if you cant find a talent
excuse me weve known him since junior year and are part of the theater club too
do you like this school
anyone good with sewing
i told you over the phone i was coming to visit
i guess there are many happy people out there
shut up you get nervous when the opportunity comes
im sure lots of guests will be there
its natural that you get leftovers
well she is working so hard every day
they can talk and yet
where is nagisa
why are you nervous
the nice to meet you bit is a little strange but thats the deal
everyone who accepted them is happy
fuko is only picking up extra wood and carving in open classrooms
join the theater club
we want to start a fuko fan club
frankly you two arent being honest with each other yet
the ghost of a female student
without a witness youd run away wouldnt you
hey hold up for a bit
tis suitcase must have gotten passed on from one person to another like tat
were you released from the hospital
but theres just too many of them
so the doctor said to keep her in bed today to be safe
it must have drifted to sore after a long time
all the teachers at this school were fans of ibuki sensei
tat way you can relax
shes a famous person in the school
but it looks like its handmade
kotomi can since the weather is so nice why not go play outside
if the reputation of the theater club drops youll cause the president trouble
so a fight with sculpting
im talking about sakagami tomoyo
she must be talking to someone in her heart
ill go to the art studio and get more scrap wood
oh yeah he has a sister doesnt he
okazaki swan you dont like club activities
its because everyone believes fuko has been discharged from the hospital
yeah theres no way a girl can beat guys
third period became a study hall
club activity when the advisor is not present is prohibited so itd be like one day on one day off
sum its something really important
but moms busy
then ill have a hot coffee
plain love it
the president makes the final decision in the end
so whats the starfish festival
theater is the best
theater
yes a sculpture of starfish fuko made with all her heart
as in the nishina swan who lent me the violin
shes right were in the middle of a fight
and with kyou chain ryou chain kotomi chain and sunohara sang as well
its like we cant leave her alone and its tickling our maternal instincts
youre going to go visit her today too right
its good to know that it was nothing
fur chain seems to enjoy herself when youre around
she was just here in this hall
is she going to give them a lecture
ill walk around and see the sights then tell my sister about them
hanging around with you keeps me free from boredom
do you have a little more time nagisa
when it comes back fixed well give it to you so old on to tat until ten
as a result shell embark on her trip again
todays the starfish festival
onii chains so hopeless
there still has to be a way around it
when youre friends with her you can eat that bread all you want
the performance is in the afternoon so why dont you go out for a stroll
please marry your boyfriend for your sisters sake too
is there something regarding me
oh really
maybe its because you were carrying fuko fuko had a very strange dream
thats good then lets go for a little walk
you cant even if youre close to each other there are lines that you cant cross
there are a lot of savage girls in our school dont you think
knife
well these are stars right
yes its nice to handle things at your own pace
so be the point guard
magic weand
yes im thinking of inviting her to the festival and letting the two of them meet
there isnt anyone around so dont worry
tomoya is what im doing with ryou a nuisance for you
ah right thats important too
fuko would like to whisper that they are to those who are likely to understand the beauty of starfish
those who agree please raise your hand
were sure itll be a great day for her
if you guys lose well have sakagami join the womens softball team
yes picnic
the regulars are bound to come in for them
let me tell you its the bikers fault
can something like this happen
all alone
sum fuko chain what does your sister call you
i wanted to preserve this place no matter what
youre a person with weird hair
the workloads of lighting and sound depend on the play
besides ryou would
okazaki swan is something wrong
wonderful i see youre willing to come to school again
we werent really her friends yet
ill pack it in the bento
it could just be that nagisa forgot about it and actually saw the play in the past
sweet bean bread
she said it was a sad story so its probably not a happy ending
the only teacher who is not advising any club is koumura sensei
hey good bath right
youre the one at fault arent you
we never know how the future shifts because of the slightest change
a kind woman and a man with a strong sense of responsibility
and about your present
to be honest i wanted to do it at the school
her partner is named yusuke sand
i want to come and see these sakura every year with everyone as a family
ill do my best and make friends
listen we must win todays match
im dead
if you want something for a change of mood theres an interesting book on charms
im sorry we cant go out on a day like this
oh a coaster
fuko never knew such a person existed
honestly its a bother
what rival
yes if we all work together im sure
im only here to meet you today
theyre the starfish bread i spent my entire golden week making
this family loves guests as always
no wonder she was strange
you take a position like this and shoot right
your hair color is so unnatural
okazaki swan if you have something you like let me know
so can you let her
yeah about a hundred years ago
no hes fukos enemy
yeah he said youre so pathetic to team up with those bottom of the barrel guys
the two people in the pictures looked like they were enjoying their lives
he had to quit the club he joined as part of a sports recruitment for the school
the one and only warmth in this world
i dont think theres anything in the school code that prohibits eating in others classrooms
im not sure where to start
rather it was a dream that didnt make any sense
and they only have this year left to them
fantasia story by the theater club
is your election campaign going well
youre ichinose kotomi and your breasts are pressed right against my back
last year i was away from school for a long period of time
im busy
ill see you tomorrow tomoya kun
dont make me look like an idiot
a girl in a world that ended
you say an incantation as you twirl it in the air and then you transform with flying stars
with my sister there too
third floor of the old building
she said because okazaki swan is a delinquent he cant force himself to be proactive
hey youre trying to make sales and using the fact were in a bind to your advantage
this is a world a hundred years since then
the end
damn that rugby club
the letter was something i did by myself
what are you hesitating about now
no its very interesting so let me remain a spectators
this is x cogs theta
no please stop you really are the worst
what do you mean
fukos situation does bother me too
all right good one brat
since the class presidents of the two classes are twins we decided to combine forces
its been a dream of his to go to a cafe with a girl
we gave out a lot today too
my mother died in a car accident when i was little
besides they have to be enjoying their lives right now too
you have a big bag there
that girl was all alone in the entire world
is there something wrong with her
the blades chipped
what did that idiot think of
you look wonderful its great
freshmen and juniors may be interested but
she wouldnt be right
your hand hurts right
this is a world that has ended
oh my we have a acute guest
in the end you were the one who was in the right
to tell you the truth her family runs a bakery
kouko ibuki the art teacher who quit three years ago
thats the one that was in the music room wasnt it
shes talked to over half of the school by now
want yen for a bit of allowance
her complexion looked better than other days
it takes only seconds before sound waves come out from the moment she takes position
tat suitcase must have traveled the world
a a maidens inspiration
fukos nose felt really strange just now
like old pictures and diaries
do we have a guest
do you want a friend
my home environment is a mess
starfish
hey sunohara
its an apple pie
three
you just said something really rude didnt you
they werent lying or joking around
for some reason she interests me
im always clumsy
you have to be the center of things
youre always just getting beaten up
basketball
well meet her in person and ask
im trying to reestablish the theater club
you dont want to deliberately ask for pain do you
lend me your strength
what happened to your practice
ill study a lot too
such a scar doesnt exist to begin with
what kind of tastes does she have
if anything id like to know how to get the advisor back from the choir
kyou shoot it
im surprised to see you interested in a damn thing like a club
its been weeks since you started dating so this is a problem
im sakagami tomoyo a junior
i would be happy if you would become my friend
it still is
youre not going to the club room today
ride chain loves music after all
since the theater club is closed right now no club activity should be happening
what is he saying
fuko chain is making those sculptures to get people to celebrate her sisters marriage right
thats what duty is about what morality is about
well maybe thats what this feeling is
jab jab straight
yes it is
we shall live alone in a forest nobody ever enters
hold on just a moment ill go talk to the others
are you misae sagara who manages the boys dorm
this world indeed had ended
sanae swan is beautiful and akio sans cool too
oh no the dango are
and yet fuko still prefers starfish
its a big star
if she were to come to school
the rugby club
ureshii koto kanashii koto mo zenbu marumete
even when they are filled wit sadness and tears
they look gross
a ghost
there was a bush accident at the intersection below and there was a crowd of people
after all im kind to girls
such a beautiful person
im sure itd be fun to be with her
whats with talking to me like im a stranger
fuko think fuko is here doing this because fuko cant see or talk to her
people like me and you come looking for help from the original
inside was a catalogue of teddy bears
the most important things are always very simple
next episode preview no i dont
this is the present with your heart in it
then all the others placed around the school got
the girl who lives in a vacant unmoving world
you think so
ill let you off without paying the repairs fee
shes not the type to be moved by something like that
yet you became friends with me again
so believe in your words
ill live to my fullest with the okazaki cyborg
you look great in your uniform too
someone from the basketball team said something rude to her
my house the yard father and mother
looking at it in reverse is there a chance of one attaching to fuko too
no im her mother
whats with the reaction
and her weapon is the violin
for the first time my daughter said wat se wants
they said if you like it that much would you like to use it for a while
hey if you cry you cant do research
you match so well with my beautiful mother
botany you came again
walk around the school campus one time
im thinking about becoming a kindergarten teacher
i did say to do as you like
there might be people whod pick a fight with me if they see my face
possibly because of that popes fell into alcohol and gambling and stopped working
he was famous from his high school days in student theater
there were children around the same age as feu chain too
your lifes a paradise every day isnt it
whats in there is us from the past when we were still chasing our dreams
what is this charm for anyway
nagisas physically weak to begin with
okay then i guess we can still go for a walk
kyou chain ryou chain nagisa chain
wouldnt it be interesting to say that were dating when we wake up tomorrow
at our school
fujibayashi you were safe
we thought we could help enliven her sisters wedding
how did it go nagisa
scrum
no theyre starfish
i burnt father and mothers paper
when tomoyos in big trouble
i was thinking that i was acting like a normal girl at this school
both okazaki sang and sunohara swan are very rude
well im having them help me reestablish the theater club
thats your bento for the day
if nagisa chain isnt going to do it then ill go destroy the choir with force
we didnt avez timeand couldnt send im from the airport
are you her classmate
more violin practice
when ibuki sensei sees feu chain working hard im sure shell be very happy too
thats absolutely impossible
my parents didnt get along
fuko likes starfish
but we still have lots to do
you did it on your own
so kotomi chain has always remembered you
dribble
please calm down for now kyou chain
hey staff the placement of the prize is wrong
really
just visiting is fine to start
are you fuko chains friend
oh come over here stand and look
what were you guys talking about
planned
fuko understands the beauty of the big dango family
first of all
its a charm that gets you locked in a gym equipment storage room with a girl
why are you here
its a private matter
there is a person in a world like this
yeah so what
no its my fault
oh come on let me play with it a little
i told you over the phone that id come visit
sorry i bothered you
hes such a scaring friend isnt he
im heading out to sunoharas place a bit
hes the same in the sense that he had to give up on a dream midway through
just because it cant be proven scientifically you must not laugh at miracles
whats there for you to hold back over
okazaki swan youre so rude
youre all here already
something strange happened after you and nagisa chain went off
youre father and mothers very very precious treasure
yeah if tomoyo wins the election all the problems would be solved
yes we want to take part in the school festival
you dont call this a sport
get me a milk coffee okay
like a reason she has to insist shes fuko ibuki
same thing will happen to you once you have a daughter too
there might be a reason
isnt it hard to deal with kinds
in other words kotomi kuns parents
pick the best choice okazaki sand
okazaki swan you say things like that every day
dont worry about it its only a short trip
but if so shouldnt you seriously face him
sensei im happy you came
sanae do you have any good names
theres no need for that
whats with that lame clapping
the bad guy
kyou chain and the others should be expecting us and have a celebration party ready
everything seemed like a dream
so she enters that state when nagisa hugs her too
how she got in a car accident the day of the entrance ceremony and how shes been in a hospital ever since
what was that nagisa chain
sunohara swan you should go to the health center fast
but you and sunohara right how could i not get turned on
really that wasnt my intention
or do you not mind becoming unable to come to school
of course theyre not
im the only guy
for example this
honestly im still thinking
this might be harder than we were thinking
you gave into the choir members tears and gave koumura sensei to them
what do you plan on saying in the middle of the classroom
thats this weeks new release
its similar to the school festival that always happens in may
can you say that one more time
your house is on my way to school
lets see
please accept it if you like
hey you alone
thank you so much for coming all this way
everyone is accepting it
thats not something you should be asking your daughters friend to do
after all i see her in bed every day
we can carve these while minding the store
can she go back alone
weve lived separately even though weve lived in the same house
a song if we insert a song at the climax im sure itll be very exciting
she couldnt play the violin as well as she used to either
it can be repaired but it couldnt be fixed for today
im sure thatll be soon
oh im sorry
this looks like more work than id expected
id like to give proper thanks
tomoya you just said something interesting didnt you
just so you know thats a star not a starfish
all those tuners intertwine with each other and a unique melody is born
so youre not dating nagisa either right
also when it comes back theres no guarantees that itll play with the sound it used to
it obviously doesnt exist
rather than pork cutlets lets get a big dango family and bring it home
my house is the bakery further ahead in front of the park
ill find tomoya or youhei later and have them baby sit her
my memory is stagnant
youre wealthier than id thought
kyou are you in here
good job nagisa
whats your relationship with her
see how many new things have arisen with the light
ill do my best to find more people who will celebrate the wedding
are they changing courts next
please lend us your strength
will we still make it in time
im home
imagine how sad sanae would be
your parents know about ibuki sensei right
are you an idiot or something
this is a starfish
why are we all working so hard for her
but she can put junk together and create something new
i hope the father is sane
will people come to the open house
thats right theres nothing to worry about
ill hear you out over there
you know enrolling to play sports right
if you think about it the club closed down since everyone that was interested in theater left
when i become the student council president i will double the menu at the cafeteria
hes right fight kotomi
ive never seen a shot from a basketball player up close
i want to go meet koumura
no you dont have to read it
you grub your eyes with the sleepy face still in dark
i heard the number of members was small to begin with
how about we ask koumura sensei to be the advisor for both clubs
hes been like that ever since
yes yes lets get back to work shall we
why else would i get myself involved with the theater club
youre not a bother at all
you were making starfish all this time

not everything was fun and games
im not distressed over my parents anymore
it would be difficult given the situation
tetsurou said e wasnt in love wit anyone
umi is such a perfectionist
youre toe starring actress so tell me wat you want
theres so much nature left
i feel like an idiot for worrying so much
it was a lot topic between the first years too
my body feels cot
familiar spirits are usually left outside during meals
unfortunately i come from a world wit none of tat stuff
o its brass
its fine so move it
they said tat toe teacher carries part of the responsibility sincese let me use magic even tough the class warned her
you cant even understand your masters orders
im looking forward to tomorrow

wow wat a feast
we dont have any previous cases of plebeians becoming familiar spirits
hey wat was tat about
whats wrong wit tat woman
w wat was tat
my element is earth just like yours missus
they say tat toe summoned familiar spiritis a perfect match for its summoner
hey maybe you just brought a plebeian you found walking the streets to begin wit
if you do youll lose your chance to get married
continue wit the ceremony
its probably her again
there your clothes
tis is a rune tat appears only on the legendary familiar spirit
anyway both of you calm down
thats a unique name
whats your name

id have been happier to be separated
my name is mars cevreuse and im a newteacer ere at trysting magic academy
looks like youre finally awake

o punishment
please do not distort your rose like face wit anger
thats strange
weter its a plebeian or not there will be no exceptions

tat pesky interference is you

papa tis guy insulted me
i get it

o etats forbidden ground
youre all the more beautiful than ever
yes its an impressive drawing
o i get it
always looking so depressed
i want to become like tat too
how long have you two been there
perhaps tat means
well it cant be helped
today ive brought the money that ive been saving up
i knew you would come
im very happy
lets begin the investigation
the girl from a well to do family whom yuuto took by force wit is desires and carnal lust
youre still ere
so if you please haruka sama
a lovely dovey date
in case there are too many people lets meet one our before at nine
he gave me tis book when i was crying in the park
this time ill
a i know
my my tis is the suterland heir etats certainly worrisome
altoug umans kill and eat a wide variety of life forms
it would only be natural for im to be keeping a few secrets from us
a dead dog isnt a dog anymore
compare is life to yours
id rather be dung than be eaten by those monsters
are you really mitsuyo sans nephew
someone keeps dumping truckloads of garbage without permission
we think it must be your enemy
its the female teacher wo vanished from is gig school tamiya ryouko
try to be careful if youre walking around at night alone
i dont think so
are you a parasite too
its brought lunch
someone wit the same ability as you
is is brain entirely human
hey izumi kun
you wearing the gray coat
next up in the news
you are izumi sinici kun right
it appears human children are more perceptive taen adults
it appears so
its okay
theres a body over terehis reads been based in
hey do you know about tis
playing games during class
it wasnt human
hey come wit me to the bookstore
we cant just let them be
you should stay a right and miki
is triggering widespread panic due to lack of credible information
on tat premises the common purpose tat blinds us
i ope youve all read up on the rules
izumi
you should be more wary of traffic accidents
there are times umans cant back down from a fight
sinici i sense my kind
you are izumi sinici kun right
i dont get you sinici
yea tat sounds about right
but i take tat back
youve been acting strange all day
it could be because of tat scar actually
wat is it migi
hes not staying at your hotel
anyone wo saw tat and still thinks they can fight them is crazy
animals avoid fights they cannot win
i think itll be a bit difficult to bring your body back intact
of my cells tat avez dissipated into your body
tis igly toned ability at all itd probably just be im
kitayama was killed and eaten by a monster right close by
ses ere
of course
thats my line
sinici upon researcing toe concept of demons
tat is the most effective delegation of roles
but its true tat their faces can change
and i doubt they would bother to infiltrate capillaries
the things you say always manage to piquet my interest
you guys dont get to touch im
before you were totally different
im more worried about muranos class right now
it seems the other as sensed me too
but weve managed to put some distance between us and im
there are way too many strange things happening lately
dont forget to turn off the stove and lock the door
most likely the male we met yesterday
tat doesnt have a sred of empaty
why are you putting her on a pedestal
youll pay for killing mom
its about meters away from us
se must be somewhere behind tat building
picking up a woman u
o one else is come today
not really
a dog shaped lump of meat
i would have liked to have discussed many things wit you both
if es really thinking about coexistence wit umans
lets watch a movie for starters
is it not possible
a snake
izumi sinici is a parasite
we cant afford to waste time ere
migi you cant tell how many there are
im not a normal human being
is tat effective
would you be willing to forego your carts in order to prevent polluting the air
hes directly below us
but you really took off in a panic u
he said they were looking for ways to coexist wit umans
are you tat worried about your dead
thats muranos class
do you really kill people
im only an assistant inspector
meters
i would do everything in my power to prevent stem
o im tired
i dont care for meat tat contains alcohol
and im supposed to clean tis up
why did you enter the school grounds without permission
toys are so easily broken
but lets not engage in futile resistance
to get to the beac you have to circle around tat way
thats were everyones dead
we were assigned to the same room for the entrance exam
akamura swan your laundry
wo knew tat a monster like you would
im starving
like tamura reiko before them some gradually altered their diet
tat much blood means its fatal
the guy trying to pretend es a hero
all right come wit me
its morning
hey wait im practically in the lead ere
tis time the parasite named tamura reiko approached you
but tis crowd is preventing im
were linked by fate
ill pretend to attack but ill focus on defense
tis is all your fault
are you back to nab another girl
youre a scary one
even if noting was going on
my wife was the breadwinner for a time
i may not look it but ive calmed down quite a bit
itd be easy to get it under seconds too
mother and child
i ope so
youre acting weird
sorry ill just have some toast
i ope not
removing any non human material from the sensor image
its about mom and the monster
thatll make my defense practically impenetrable
they are without a doubt neighbors deserving of our respect
migi is not capable of affection
unable to take is dead you are now under human control
how could you put such a ottie in front of me
theres a spot wit a great view of the city lights
well now how rare
as if the parasite is asleep
based on our analysis of the body in our dining area
asking me to believe your story is far more unreasonable
youre so fickle
a bunch of hunters are going to get together tomorrow
wat do you think happened as a result
but are you okay
why wander around somewhere youve never been in times like tease
but rather implicitly suggesting the means of distinguishing
coexist u
he got an artery close to the earth
the left and
city workers souled wait as long as they can
yea looks like theyre enjoying college life to the fullest
approximately meters away
damn izumi
se was just messing wit me
but ses human right
shut up
there are several parasites in tis city all
you look exhausted
im sure its amazing
if i am to decapitate gotou went is power and speed far surpasses my own
at first take over the brain is our only goal
it was for humanity or really more for me as an individual
right now if se were to
in fact merely behavior to better toe transmission of an individuals da
a massacre at a yakuza office
you saved my life
when you pull out human air noting happens
if you have the right to live
friends have died for me too
even if they did sow it
i dont sense independent tougt in is arms movements
im going to have you prove your ability once and for all
not human
humans and the upper and from the start
youre contradicting yourself
w we have an intruder
izumi are you sure you arent actually strong
thats none of your business
if only i can find and destroy the body ill win
shut up
please get back in line
if parasites learned to exist without killing umans thered be no problem right
my right and just moved and
the bloods from tat broad
im surprised myself
is tat true
it felt rather pleasant
it took your mothers dead
but wo killed tat parasite
even tough ive seen so many man eating monsters
how can you be so calm
and consequently spread fragments of flesh emanating animosity around you
so you have only met those two types so far
has my wifes body been found
from around tat corner
thats why i want more data
why are other guys so much better at keeping themselves in control
i cant keep you ere forever
the one on her right is a and the two on her left are and
he wont get elected
there is no need for you to feel responsible
if were going to do tis it should be soon
five more seconds
but wat about me wat do you think i am
sinici were do you think youre going
yea etats wat witnesses say
izumi
youre not human
youre right
rather than aiming for the legs or torso go for the head
inspector hirama
retrieved the body
but by the time morning comes ive forgotten most of it
but the angle of attack is still poor
wat do you mean by should we stay silent
satsuki squad protect the sensing system
ten how can such an alien cell type form connections wit the human body
tat kind of makes me happy
youre a perfectly fine human being
tat female kana her power as grown stronger
hes way too dense
youll be isolated and turned into an experimental subject or a sample
he said to think of people like cattle and pigs
dont stay out too late
o okay
blood
sinici its cold
half her head
o detective
you saved my life
either way our conversation is generating a certain amount of noise
migi my right and isnt responsive enough
youre getting on my nerves
s sure dwy
he is certainly a danger
you seem quite strong
o way
itll be too late if we detect her as se snows up at the hospital
but tat is also wat we want
is survival
ice sot
im surprised myself
you know youve changed recently
today is the day
a snakes in my arm
but your restored heart was much stronger than id expected
wat wouldve happened if youd succeeded in taking my brain
se will not use umans in her immediate social circles as food
but there can be rejection
i apparently said something strange to her
from the lower half of is face to the front of is neck
its inside tis building
i wonder waits wrong
combat will be impossible in these circumstances
if defiance is your final answer dont pretend otherwise at the start
satomi was worried about you too
but it is at the municipal level
ill leave your shoe ere
everyone ere is trying their best to forget wat happened
however perhaps it is now time to make it public knowledge
if you do it again tough youre toast
get is cuffs
and weve been living our lives close to someone else
yes im sure you can
i dont
friend
to augment the sealing of the wound
its awful went so many sad things happen
how can i hum
o not really
why didnt you tell me right ten
youll have forgotten all about tis dream when you wake up like usual
to a it should pose a most inconvenient obstacle
im sure someone already as
im starting to get the bang of telling the monsters apart
isnt tat right
my dead got hurt on is trip
wat do you mean by tat
but should you come looking for a fight again for no good reason
thats a lie
i pierced the earth
you can just call im parasite
i got a call from your school so i rushed over
so some other specific change mustve occurred
and do not approach wing a under any circumstances
its beautiful
dont worry
dont be ridiculous
tis is an experiment
wat we can do tat a cannot
thats right you
ses going to eat everyone
were just going somewhere we can talk
use your life
tat is now animals live
so it was a trap
we even pulled out one of is airs just in case
wat do you mean
but give some tougt to as many things as many ideas as you can come up wit
hey draw is face for me sometime too
hes really messed up
its a baby
and regarding the other one the mayor hirokawa
to a parasite the body is our lifeline as well as our greatest weakness
when is soon
izumi kuns not bad
continues to teach as tough nothings changed
well lets just monitor the situation for now
you people are all crazy
call it human ego or whatever you want
a total fraud
are you sad
thered be a huge uproar
its not like i see im tat often
if we take tis any further ill become a murderer
o etats unlikely
i wont be back at school for a while
in the end im trampling over tosearound me in order to live
hey wat was tat sound
wheres my bacon and eggs
since when are you and izumi a thing
all right lets go together
but es truly just an average gig school student
we were able to win today
ive had enough
its from a public prone
and there was a need for a neutralizer
even dogs and cats have the abilityto measure their opponents strength
mutsuki and kisaragi squads are to rendezvous in the main entrance all
it was living off the dogs organs and digestive system as id suspected
wat about the man
but to me you are just a hindrance
hes my classmate
one misstep and we will have to fight to the death yet again
yea of course
s sorry
humans
do not let im get away
tis guys being way too accommodating
they should be safe
wat are you up for
its important
and never go after tat guy again
could it be tat
you know im the true human ere
but you should just let adults handle tis sort of thing
i i was just joking
obviously its killer b
tat scar on your and
so youre really moving forward wit tis umans
but i want to mourn her death more
kuramori can it be
its not the same
i merged wit is body as it approached a near death state
im looking forward to gym
there mustve been at least one more parasite
tat was amazing u satomi
an estimate is fine
its possible they just advent found any bodies yet
youre right
so theyre using large sotgun rounds to destroy the body
were gonna pay you back in full for wat you did
a man armed wit a trifle as entered the building
meet the one wo opened tat mole again
there are pretty grapic videos being upped to the net too
mincemeat murders
plus you would lose your right and
are you okay
but you said im not the only one wo can make you feel tat
its not like
its close
i heard from again
o noting
hes come early
are you incapable of shedding even a single tear
i it was just a joke
but my heads empty
but tis is a bit much dont you think
yes it was just like tis
out of kindness to an old friend
tat monster
thats not it
w wait tamiya sensei
you misunderstand me
wat about my right and
yea tis was worth rousing over in a taxi
so heres a question for you
lets go over there
sorry go on without me
anyone would panic when something tis messed up happens
its just tat we need to stay close to a certain locations
shut up
izumi
and even maternal love
its my body
hey wat are you doing
in war wat matters is opportunity not numbers
im not so sure
did you really come from outer space
do you remember the puppy tat died
the head as its hands full coordinating the arms and other parasitic components
our eyes met
but the fragments are not conscious
simple communication is possible
right mom
my internal structure as been altered yet again
are you hurt
its been almost four ours now
do you know were sakurazaki hospital is
they have to be of a certain size at minimum
if words are all you want ill say anything
however i would like is body to be brought back intact
one of your friends maybe or
wat we might want to do as individuals no longer as any significance at tis stage
right now you seem numb to fear
so thats is goal
all right stop
a trip
the sensing systems down
the murdered pies notes mentioned something relevant
how was it
you killed the man named kuramori just now
sorry i have to go take care of something
my earning is one example
his right bands signal is weak
he hasnt called again since
a trip
izumi
you have excellent speed and motion detection
over time my kind as evolved
they are not a flock of sleep wo can be erded by dogs
students are to follow their teachers instructions
but most people wouldnt have given tat puppy any tougt at all
wat was tat sound
something tore troug toe parasites ribs gouged out its earth
or perhaps you have an ability to tell them apart
ten the one wo was sot dead in the park was tamura reiko
im getting worried
having such a foreign element working wit our tactical forces in an operation
ill talk to the teacher and ask to go home early
well now resume evacuations
he doesnt have to be so terrified
tat idiot
i couldnt care less
o way
stop acting like a hero
ill make you pay
wat now
ten slammed it against the wall wit enough force to destroy the wall itself
ses ere
hey izumi
demon
so now you dont even care about your parents
on the other and if you fight effectively we will win
learn to old back a little idiot
it was failure on my part to let you handle dealing wit the pit
its fine ten
you ran at the speed of an olympic atlete
you look like youve been troug a lot
we protect the environment because umans themselves dont want to go extinct
mom whats up wit you
i havent beard any reports of murders in her vicinity
was is right and moving in a peculiar way for example
we are putting heart itself at risk
and calls to capture all the parasites
if you dressed up as a woman you might make good spank material
but tat feeling goes away after a while
you wit your locations in your most
so even a cold blooded monster values her own child
it will be a massacre
he poses some danger to us
yea the man we ran into before
like the mincemeat murders
for now lets meet it in a public place
sure fine
i wont do tis at the school
you still want to fight im
just come out and say it
im stuck in a nightmare
i should gradually recruit cells from all over is body
the corps and the government are already doing something about it
kusano bore animosity toward tamura reiko for awhile
you are at a greater disadvantage since you cannot change your face
wat happened in tat park didnt even make the news
its rejecting me
a mother u
my right and is being kept alive by my blood
humans cant do it alone
but its impossible to understand each other
they werent for the sake of earth or anything
you going to see im again
the school reopened and classes resumed
for wat purpose we have come into existence
our equipment got it by friendly fire
but first wed like you to ear our side of the story
i havent seen you aroundare you a transfer student
sure i do
it was the same earlier today too
life must be protected
is something wrong wit your right and
but in tis crowd
you idiot
mainly as food
its about meters straight tat way
youre different from now i imagined youd be
in a word culling
come to think of it tamura reiko often asked
and a murder in miyagi were the body was hung up like laundry
he as incredible power
you mean like from a god
call the police
so you will be staying at a hotel for a few more days at least
tat means its surviving on normal food for umans
he still as is human brain
you took the buds yesterday evening didnt you
obuko
a right and stretching out and attacking me
something just went out of sight at the other end
but because the core itself morped into wings
i have a plan
his legs
are you stupid or something
might be weird wavelengts given off by dangerous guys like im
second let us know if one of their kind is among them
conceal tat weapon
wat we need
itll only hurt more if you do
my kind are simply eating
given tat our human bodies are our weakness
to protect the ive went predators appear
a weakness tat others of my kind do not have
se checked out the next morning
wyre you putting pebbles in your bag
come to think of it i also got tis burn back ten
you can be pretty simple minded sometimes
but because you said itd be fine
why didnt you run away tis morning
someone on earth and a sudden tougt
itll benefit us both
animals arent toys
its just a game
he cant possibly get elected without a solid grasp of human psycology
it was at least tree meters tall
sports are very good
and only i can unify everyone
moving on to traffic information
they advent caught im yet
hey youre looking better today
i might regret tis now
i work at a hotel in the next town over
so it can morp into anything
but tat means you wont be able to id the enemy
i didnt think it would end tis way
are you okay
does tat include my brain
we are merely a life form tat cannot survive on its own
its range is quite small as well
you wanted to mate wit tat female didnt you
we are currently meters away from tamiya ryouko
my face and voice should be practically indistinguisable from tamiya ryoko yet
wyd you do tat
into things tatre beyond you
after a time our school reopened
se was mentioned in is story
ive killed so far
tell im to look me right in the eye
and tamiya sensei will be the assistant omeroom teacher
like a weapon
he was acting like something really bad was going on yesterday too
tis is real isnt it isnt it
hey yuko
but you still cant understand
mikis supposed to go tomorrow
but you and bugs
hes the one wo found the victim
first about my own body
it may not be our enemy
but could be characterized as sentiment muscle
o noting
we are the children of the human race
how did se find our address
the babys clothes avesome of my blood on them
youre more formidable taen id tougt detective
my life is at stake
a is within tree meters of us
there there
ill take full responsibility
tis body will die
are you made of steel
wat as actions thus far have told me
if you talk out loud on top of tat
my sincere condolences for your wife and child
humans
when you come to visit can you bring im things like clothes and
o you need to have a proper breakfast
i just want to know how many of them have gathered ere
monster
ses lying
tat snake like thing is wat you really look like right
a direct it to the earth cannot be repaired in mere minutes
we saw tis lady wo only and half her head
its right behind the hospital
sinici youd better not be on drugs
meet tat person and talk everything over to bring closure
theres supposedly a hotel near the beac you should stay there instead
these would be way too obvious
its important
you know tis might be the first time weve been gone for so long
even wit the human brain intact youre actually stronger
stupid mommy
he even suspected me of being one of the monsters
lets play in the sandbox
help me
in comparison your feelings toward me are not as
but i think its true
if thats true ten wat can one lone human possibly accomplish
tis toys pretty fragile
the defense
just wondering wat ended up happening to them
spiders know how to spin webs without being taught
yes thats right
therell be no way for me to recognize im
but tat woman is on another level entirely
id ate to be turned into mincemeat
im sure of it
in comparison umans are the true parasitic vermin infesting tis planets
did you ear about tat incident
welcome back
parasites have now secured a safe raven and a food source
and thats why youve stayed near tis hospital all tis time
its just a spiders
i see
i is tat its earth
my cells tat have dispersed in your body
please stop tis
w wo toe ell are you
like maybe is personality or is way of thinking
o and mom
even murders can be chalked up towild beasts feeding themselves
ive called migi cold blooded a lot
you have friends in my class do you not
a woman
you will pose a great treat to us all in the future
if we lope the head off
but i have concluded tat continuing to keep you in the dark
i will move swiftly to pierce is earth
was seeing tat female your real objective today
hes not human
you understand human speech so well
your feelings towards your family are quite strong
well meet up at the next corner
did you try asking tat to your right and
you idiot
of course tis theory is not without its problems
you know the monster
you are not like me or my kind
you have talent
its not tat simple
id love to get a personal lesson from a babe like her
izumi
i think it came out pretty good
friend
is there something troubling you
we are two halves of the same whole
you say the same thing every time
my bodys muscle strength exceeds yours
humans are supposed to be the most intelligent beings on the planets arent they
if we apply tis theory more broadly
a wise decision
many people have been killed
turn left up ahead
o it all happened so fast
hirama kun will be supporting tis operation by overseeing all the support functions
and ill get tat monster
an unfortunate incident indeed
in a narrow sense they were our enemies
right now its safe
the parasite tamura reiko
ive never sensed such a signal coming from one of my kind
we have to consider how to coexist wit umans from now on
maybe im a little early
i need to talk to kana
tired going to sleep
tis mans a parasite
its impossible to count their numbers
you should strike them down in a single blow without making a sow of it
if tat means you will become our enemy
for now lets evacuate wit the others
we messed up hes caught up to us
are you
somewhere wit a constant flow of fires blood
sinici i know wat youre thinking
its human nature to want to kill each other you know
o vice principal
wait were you in a fight
sow me how your right and can change scape
se spoke wit the front desk staff
fled even
im scared tat guy might be there
tis body will soon die
regarding the fact tat you are u expecting
it seems they are on foot
izumi
at the end dead finally told me outright for the first time
how is sinici
wat i really am
you have dreams like tat too
should we at least call the corps
just one
se must be tamiya ryokos mother
wat secret
but the staff saw the burn mark on tms obukos right arm
you really have no sympathy
humans stink all life is precious
thats right
thats right sinici
hey hang on
in your pocket is a lighter i found in the car
another murder
human life is precious isnt it
how do you even work
they should just sow simadas body
come back together as one
good morning everyone
izumi kun come to the guidance office later would you
did your visitors leave
but theres been no formal announcement from any public agencies
the human tat you preside in is sluggis
in cases like yours when its unclear how far the parasites influence reaches
and all it took was one monster to turn the tables on us
silver plate
tis will restore the balance at last
hur way now
so gotou cant detect stem
i dont think my stomach can old four at once
wyre you getting changed in the corner like youre hiding something
sell just be dismissed as a big school girl talking nonsense
are you okay sinici
it appears se intends to observe our fight
and wat are umans to us
do you want your father to be killed too
its somewhere among the crowd to our left
my organs are in sambles
your father will become suspicious of all the noise
whats wit the lack of enthusiasm
as well as circulate blood witing myself
there was also a lecture ere i wanted to attend
should we really stay silent about tis
are you even my own right and
i predict the direction of fire based on the opponents eye and and movements
dug so its only im after all
i felt hers on our way come from school yesterday
a a fake face
youre the second one ive met worse brain is intact
so wat ten once youre sure the baby is normal
a mother and her daughter were killed
one obvious reason was tat the battle was effective as an object lesson
compared to my host tat as unified wit me
go splas some water on your face
would you be able to kill tat baby
we just want to talk to your buddy ere
id never believe it under normal circumstances
tis is a different route from yesterday
everybody down
wyd se split in two
but my parents are a different story
sum your meals ready for you downstairs
because you tied your earpone cord around it while half asleep
ten twos going to attack
even tough your left bands all rouged up
see i knew it
i am hirama
forget tat strategy
a week as now passed since the massacre tat resulted in victims
its finally morning and still
im jealous
you like animals right
i cant agree to tat
tis guy might get seriously hurt
he wasnt in the first floor entrance all
ive only just become certain of it myself but
yea it and four front legs alone
wat does a snout nosed brat like you expect to do
at first glance altruistic behavior poses no advantage for the self
why are our opinions so incompatible
its almost time
i can tell
you okay again
for matsuyama sensei twos been ospitalized after a traffic accident
yes an ordinary human baby
he can navigate walls and ceilings as well as any floor
if gotous adopted a totally different human appearance
tell im wat kind of creature killed mom
it seems to be eating
ill sow you my power properly tis time for sure
im going to have you meet five people
sinici tat was quite a nightmare
im getting a clearer picture of is true nature now
the strongest signals we emit are animosity
youre right
its cold sinici
someone on earth and a sudden tougt
the seventh transformation by yosimi dai right
hey think thats the intruder
savage beasts u
whats her name
poor but its dead
izumi
well sure
im calling from sakurazaki hospital
my parents arent ere today
violent incidents are happening all over the nation
heres your weapon sinici
ive been troug much worse at school
a snake
my friend once told me tis
migi told me not to fight until e was awake
they say there were casualties
it is the opposite of selfisness
ill just have to use tis child as a shield
wait if kana detects tat signal
man eating monsters
so were a tired duo
but an extermination of pests
im your husband for crying out loud
its ere a parasite
in theory yes
slowly approach im
thats not wat im talking about
i doubt anyone would bother
hey detective
but youre human
are they strays
whats tis a military coup detat
or rather completely incoherent
o way
about gotou the man wo recently pursued you
not when were eating dear
tat poser called izumi or whatever
i heard your mother as gone missing
so you dont feel well but you do have an appetite
the body of an animal is merely its das puppet
there are other people wo went troug the same thing as me
leaving the city was a mistake
you can just follow the road you take to my place
it cant be
and regarding the other one the mayor hirokawa
you may even become a hero after all tis is over
i was just using my dads injury as an excuse to ditch school for a bit
but given tat theres a monster right in front of me
if we continue mindless predation like insects
however the tools you currently old should be put to different use
you said during the last fight
however before tat happened their consciousness split into five
tis isnt good

my bloods still red
we should get help
but right now please stay focused on the battle before you

well have to gambler
but tis places her in too much danger
besides we currently have the advantage
can you really win against me in tat damaged body
its the bag izumi kun left behind
if you were to tell her too much
five more meters
without total control over tat body you cannot win
make use of your life

thats none of your business anymore
wo can change like tat without trying at it
lets just off tis guy
ill call you back

but we will need to keep a distance of at least meters
the police avez revealed tat kuramori sans wife and eldest daughter
in any case i am certain tat the head is still the control center
tat is wat would make you the superior species
i believe tat among all life umans are the closest thing to it
you said you didnt want any yesterday
just finish eating and get to work
it was just a dream
but we did do better than other companies
i dont know anything about yukina
but its mostly just authors
if youve got time to daydreams finish your work
i do feel bad about it
you can start working tomorrow
if you take care of it good things will happen
i believe they went to the same college
its a bit of a stretch to get everything across wit just the expressions
takano toe snub mats is done
a true dump
did you ask yokozawa about these
tis is really bad
i guess it smells like a bunch of bikers
in the worst case i accept full responsibility
youre the one wo roundouse kicked me
why would i need to avoid you
i really respect someone wo canmake a book tat touches you like tat
and youve held a grudge for ten years
fine but upper body only
our personalities would definitely clash if we actually went out
i mustve caused you trouble
remember my email about dropping tis guy off
ive got a request for a second release of tis months edition
editors in other groups
but tat was totally normal contact between friends
todays word is maruakawas marketing department
tis smell
i really dont want to go to work
i want to touch im
thats the authors
he may be good at is job but e freaks me out
tis isnt a junior gig manga club
how am i supposed to do tat if the editor is so calf passed
i came ere to get away from work
tis months top seller was onoderas author again
grass tat cats eat
well youre the only one doing jack right now
tat publises toe monthly sojo manga magazine emerald
since you were working wit her before
the sales and circulation is managed
but wat would asking these things achieve
all e does all day is flirt and talk wit the girls
the entry all is were the new editor of the
you have kissed someone before right
if i give my best and am told tat im useless
but i dont want you sowing yourself to yanase ever again
wat are the sales figures for the worksby toe authors in front and behind her
so wat if you got a leg up
he was wit a woman
id been watching im for tree years at school
hang on isnt there a limit to how much younger you can look
youve always been obsessed wit tat
and why did takano let im in
theres no connection between the company and me
tat information needs to be reported all over
i cant even move
sees wat are you a grade scooler
one of it was romantic per se
remember how you asked me if i was in love wit anyone
yuu loves im so why cant e be honest
okay i read troug it
why did yokozawa come ere in the middle of the night
love at first sight works well enough in a manga
o my god are you a
i didnt mean to crash your vacation wit tis call
youll have to learn to work
something like se was glad i was her editor
it might be helpful for me at my next company
to be honest i want to leave right now
im twenty one and still going to university
and e was in charge of akiiko usami at is old company
if youre careless wit it bad things will happen
i have to do it quickly
even the rookie says so
theres noting going on between takano and me
everybody starts as a noob
and wat does e mean ill make you say it
wat i learned so far
would like a first printing of copies
for tis month
your name
wat do you mean work of course
his private life
apparently theyre returning the manuscript for mutous next book
tat was a surprise
at age i ritsu onodera
working ere means i get to see you guys
the last volume was really great
are you sure you dont want to be an exclusive assistant
why dont you just go and play around wit yokozawa
its probably a friction burn
excuse me but can you all be quiet for a second
stop thinking about it and do some work
i dont think thats true
i want to feel how warm e is
tis means order processing wo manages the inventory
i want you to read these tis week
were does tat random enthusiasm come from
o yanase corse well
i ended up wearing the same clothes i wore yesterday
thats because youre not just looking at my face but all of me
i can accept tat its been cleaned up
starting a new job while you move really sucks
rice is the staple of the japanese people
cant e just go home
i cant deny tat it strings
but ten se ends it wit a gag
did i do something wrong
but i wouldnt mind being at the elm of a popular project
i need to use the restroom
y you think tat would work
it is my first birthday since weve started going out
why do i always allow myselfcling to these kind of false hopes
isnt tat how it is or am i wrong
and ten disappeared the next day
u yes
hes just calling my name
usually e never laughs
i would appreciate if you refrained from claiming
ignores wat i just said
all i want to do is make books tat people will want to treasure
i see the bones
p probably
tis cannot possibly be love
but i wonder if e had gone all over to find them
well id have to check my
theres no way se can finish under these conditions
wat did e just say
o and can you look tease over
it was raining and everybody ignored
those guys make a book in day cycles
i didnt ear it
i dont want to tooth my own born
i guess you cant be botered ifyoure not participating in the meeting
thats wat you get for only judging people by their looks
dude dont judge people based on their first impression
o yea until now es
you know their works arent anything alike but they both have the same
wow really im looking forward to tat
i think itll arrive some time tomorrow
theyre putting your series on tv next year
its purpose is to make sure toe overalls flow and composition is okay
im ere as a customers
but ever since tat day es been calling
i guess im the one wo cant tell wat se needs
not tat i even want to
the meetings wit the author
i have no idea waits going on in is dead
and ten tell me why i correct my final manuscripts tis way
and tis is the writer ryouici sumi
im very sorry there are still fifteen pages left to go
id like a coffee please
so yosino ere was suggesting taton the main characters birthday
but as someone wo started atonodera publising wit you
if i had tougt tat
but are you really the heir tote onodera publising company
if youre going to sleep go to bed
still normal script check seed
and ten talk to im about it on the prone
but its not like i didnt already know tat
ten were just going back to being boss and subordinate
now you just have to run it by the author
i fall in love wit someone
ten you dont have to redo it
all i have is my useless enthusiasm running wild
if you can distinguish between tosewit a reason and those tat are random
do you have the results of mutous poll wit you
i guess but thats is job
okay so why am i getting all nervous
i dont know
why do they have to be talking there of all places
wat about the spine toe bookmark wat color
i know its probably just a standard compliment
ten why dont we compromise ataround copies plus a few
do you have an umbrella
but wat i dont get wit suck scenes
isnt tat because you actually really like me
from tis angle so you can see the coin slightly titled
he called im by is first name
but isnt it the editors job to protect the writer
yokozawa is just a friend
o so youre my new neighbor
i live right next door
it means tat i would have made those additional changes
i told you im fine
liar you havent gotten anything done yet
s sure
you werent expecting it were you
did e really have to humiliate me like tat in front of everyone
to feel wat e feels like
id like to talk about some of the jargon we use around ere
its so nice to meet you
please its fine i dont care
im probably just getting in the way
cycle
but onodera ere is really more suited to literature
we might have been at the printers at the same time or something
could i have been any more obvious
for some reason es only beendrawn to men is whole life
i know tat
was my way of looking at the storyboard okay
and ten i feel brokenearted
ill just rinsed it off wit water
wat if wat e said is true
having a dream about gig school right now is a total
its not like youre going to be around much tat night anyway
you worked really armd andput a lot of love into the book
maybe e and something prepared for me too
tat woman was all over you the whole time
why are you reeking of perfume from working
and now ten years later
souta you never fall in love wit anyone right
snub infotext composingte book youve been promoting as just and a second printing run thank you for promoting it
if i cant even ear it whats the point
be it the spas or the suit for the new years party
not so fine draft check four leaves
i always wanted to do something like tis anyway
tat was awkward
o more like from tis angle
even wit the glasses i can see the bags under her eyes
but let the author have their fun
i was supposed to sit in on teplanning meeting first thing in the morning
anyway tat doesnt mean anything i was a brat in gig school
wat exactly does yokozawa know
wat did i do
how many people do you think get to do the thing they love for work
my body aches
wat are you up to these days
my name is ritsu onodera and im twenty five years old
anyway i just have to avoid all non work contact wit im
actually i need to do tat for my career
you cant bring knives on planets anymore
tis guy is weird
hes actually twenty five
and no plans for any kind of promotion
promise me youll never go anywhere alone wit im ever again
you were always in the library back ten too
attacking without a plan is for tougtless insects
you must not lose your memories
if we destroy the heads

koikawas history

and when the sun falls and it gets cool
its only natural for them to want to trow rocks at me

hydrangea blossoms

he could never lose to an evil creature like you
the sound of the waves
fuji hammer
get im tsukisima

your father speaks the truth

if you couldnt tell them you must have had a very good reason
he is a criminal
yes coming right up
full power slap
it isnt a dream its real
he is oooka ecizen no kamitadasuke of the edo souttown magistrates
i felt like the book was telling me tis
but do not get arrogant rat

id love to help you
lets hurry to the insects magistrate
late yesterday afternoon the insects man appeared in edo
he wont keep is promise
its useless
come quickly
wo rely on your friends your sikigami and family
tsukisima donot it seems you simply will not listen
look at those two flirting government officials shouldnt flirt
justices
its fine if you dont fight
the insects magistrate is within tis poison fog
very well
ill try even harder to be the strongest samurai in japan
those big paper dolls yesterday were really cool
acidic poison
all the city patrol members except mugai donot
the insects are acting strangely
oaru donot watch out
well done tsukisima
potato boy
my name is sanada yukimura
do your best little rat
i want a relaxing life wit you
everyone

the descendant of a ninja clean and a wiz wit gunpowder
your prayer wasnt in vain mom and dead

youre too early fool
its morning tsukisima
and went tat happens we follow a certain rule
my lord

you can never attain true justice
the other ones yours new kind
i can do it
now theres an insects in fukakawa
how the insects magistrate is but a girl

so the insects men dont know us or our purpose ere
mugai donot will your partner wo went to the kitchen be safe
hydrangea bombs ten lotuses
if you agree to keep secret wat you saw ere
and youd best keep fire away from tis poison gas
tis is a battlefield
k koikawa donot theyre strong
to master the blade you must use konjac
and my mother is really pretty and good at sewing
only performing the task set before her
ill find everything we need to enjoy the fireworks
are you okay
ten we are similar
to risk is life for something so stupid
weter youre evil or not is irrelevant to us
go ten insects
youre weak
i still have yet to apologize
lets find a place within these walls you can see the fireworks from
the evacuation is essentially complete
whatever blinds you will keep you from the pat of justice
but tat meeting was secret
killing any wo stood in is way
jump on my head
the only thing they respect is my position
getting you out of there of course
the forbidden tecnique dream of the butterfly
i told you to use sama maggot
he killed anyone wo got in is way
the magistrate as no freedom
of the magistrates office called tsukisima jinbei
stop your squeaking rat
ten bring me the heads of these rats
water is mine to control

the records of the insects magistrate
give me back my face
f faster please

sanada yukimura waits atop tat castle
but wat is the reality
tis is the best chance ill ever get
miss are you safe
and ten came my first opponent
there are too many
miss would you like to marry my son
i cant let someone like you sit on a straw mate
hibaci donot and irori donot are securing a way into the castle
heavy like lead heavy like hell

and would prefer to stay ere all the time
full power slap
ten i ope youll let me have some fun
im going to be stupid
and the ultimate bug appears in edo

its been so long lets talk
so sweet so kind

princess aah
due to a mistake tat fool koikawa killed all those people
so youre heading out to find the magistrate now arent you
i wont allow tat
they are specialists at insects extermination
insects tat looked like men
our goal lies before us
so e called me ere to sow tease off u
pain is also a pat to justice
someday ill get to sow the insects magistrate
hes stronger than any foe ive ever faced
you bastard you killed them all
i knew it
the city patrol
if i fail the people at mot fujis base will die
but if they are not captured witing ten days
its a bug

the servant is about to fulfill her task
wait does tat mean
holding a girls and tis late
my poison kills anyone wo makes direct contact wit my body
you never know when youre about to go into battle
im ere for one reason
take care of tat girl
ill stop you using my full power
did jinbei kun do something rude
we cannot waste time searching for additional personnel
a heart tat cares for others
people of our rank cant meet wit someone like tat
at last we meet insects magistrate
use your authority to get koikawa donot out of prison
my hands are stained as black as the swamp
why did you choose me for tis mission
fireworks
he was the most suited to the task
i wont let tat kind have all the fun
dont disappoint me
id like to meet im
yes lets be more careful next time
we work for the insects magistrate fighting bugs every day
you bastard
if you dont come out quickly something horrible will happen to her
my father

he learns fast perhaps thanks to your blood
wat kind of skill is tat
he isnt creating the illusion wit a drug
irori im glad youre doing well
when people say tat its a arbinger of death
not bad
dont let im humiliate us again guys
water gods army
wat else could we want from a frontier castle like tis
please use your vast stores of knowledge
hydrangea blossoms
jingaitou transformation
i remember now
everyone im cutting your salary
or the people behind me tat im protecting will be lost to terror
a scum woman like you would be unnecessary
in a safe place
i dont need your apologies
were is the magistrate
miyamamura should be ere somewhere
im sure tat sound is hibaci neesama and her friends
oaru can went missing last night
i watch jinbei every day from tis place
seems a long time since we were all together
i must also furry
he shouldnt talk to me tat way
h how dare you even try insects
wat a terrible dream
how sad
a hundred at most
in a way you and i are comrades
for you to mock tat
im not a stupid kind
and tat smile tat was only for me
your skills are simply astonishing
but e didnt do it
from ere you can clearly see the magistrates office
so annoying and gross
tat will be difficult but if tat is your request
tis is a secret tecnique of koga style insects injutsu
always be ready for a fight
even using a beat up old katana like tat
a single insects man mouri katsunaga defeated stem
beyond a hundred or a thousand you will cease to feel at all
hydrangea blossoms
se seems to have gained the power tat fills the well
well done matsunoara kotori
im glad to have you ere ten
force is all thats left
but one day it was stolen from my master
i wonder if tsukisimas okay
im honored tat you would worry over someone like me
youre merely an idiot rushing to your dealt
a legend about the insects
ten the whole world is wrong
and i think es forgotten about me
i said it was noting
something important
wat a nice bait
tsukisima get those two out of ere
i found a carpet
he makes you think you want to be like im
and they sound much better than the preparations
not just anyone can do it
there is no need to worry
so the time of your awakening as finally come princess
is anyone in fighting scape
im looking forward to it
lets go miss
only the male
tis smoke is from tatc and mugwort
you probably have one last chance
tsukisima you rested yesterday so youd better work armd today
expectations u
a samurai helps others
theyre looking into those serial robberies
kotori donot told me to hurry ere to wait for someone
storm
far stronger than sarutobi sasuke
but every summer fortress class insects like tat appear
you cant deceive me wit those eyes
konjac is very hard
ill do my best so mugai swan will praise me
listen the thirty six blades of fuji are
for the first time in ten years ive ventured outside in person
how ten there is noting more to discuss
my stomacs already full but
lord yosimune i would like to speak wit your son
wat is tat urge insects
we couldnt even scratch them but you dispatched them in an instant
yea thats right
to associate myself wit something common anyway
he will be my target
agatomimaru sama is no good
the person at the top
a huge fleas as appeared in the kitchen too
is it going to jump
but those two seem to be having fun
mugai donors overwhelming strength makes those behind im feel safe
everyone please be careful
they were already dead
ten one of them is an illusion
they called us insects men
im actually on my way to see the fireworks now
wat lies beyond kisuu
se had become someone far more human than myself
wick seven priests disseminated trougout toe togoku region
ill burn stem
the ten crucifix insects simply obey our lord yukimura sama
you two go on ahead
living ere alone would be too lonely for me
everyone so devoted to their task
are you hurt
koikawa check tat no ones still in the town over there
full power corkscrew punch
to the sogunate se was a mere tool for keeping the insects away
dont let it bother you potato boy
in its own way tis is fun
tat someday theyll protect us from the insects
hes keeping up wit tat monster
well done everyone
my cannons had no effect
can no longer move
my so youll be mugai samas partner
theres no odor
one justice
shall escort you to the castle
se seemed to accept her fate
but your next attack is too slow
mugai donot did you just say the insects magistrate
heres the last one for today
even you cannot be told
so the traitor leads the way
kirigakure saizou you arent strong at all
they must be nearby
the wrong one tat idiot
if its a dream get rid of tat sting
lately there have been way too many insects
wed better get started
after all tat youre snapping on her lap
a samurai
guess the new kinds a morning person
regarding the insects men my one fear is koikawa donot himself
rat you have my compliments
the world is impermanent epemeral
hydrangea blossoms

oooka is one of my most trusted men
well gather food in mot fujis forests
illusion magic
also kirigakure saizou whom i defeated
im going to kisuu province
everything in tis world as a flow
hopes

how to the east
the city patrol really is a bunch of low class incompetents
my memories will disappear
tis is a dream
double arrow

do you have any food
thats right
soon you will be in paradise
full power slap
cant even kill a man is tat you spoil im
our army is finished
everyone wo knew im long ago
there is little time left
just when it was getting good too
but were finally about to get started
the bombs hidden in your cest are about to explode
right now were in the midst of an important mission
please escape on your own magistrate
ten why are we going to kisuu province
dont be stupid
so tat those behind you will not be afraid
the eldest son of the eight sogun yosimune sama
munenao you cannot remain ere any longer
he followed in is fathers footsteps
ill be okay wit insects cramped spaces gig places or dark spaces
a group called the insects hunters is almost ere
were inside the enemy castle
tat wasnt deliberate was it
princess aah is regaining her power
not the people of kisuu and not the servant
my rank and position are far beneath the magistrates
her life
looks like you fought like another idiot
is a counter tecnique tat reads the flow of your opponents strike
i cant control it
i have already saved twenty
even your power changes noting
the city patrol
you are no mere rat
it as to be a dream
tis is important and could affect your work
he scattered a mountain
the road ere sucked
supposedly the island as two big mountains
princess as you know
the hearts of men have fallen so far
however it is a useless eat
a legend
jinbei ill give you one hint
theres no way to know how the wells evil energy will affect you princess
your kindness in trying to protect tat insects was right
it brings back so many memories to see you again princess aah
i am tsukisima genjuurou of tsugaru
o one respects me
lets hurry to the insects magistrate
the tiny red blade tat pierced your cest
yes father
isnt tat idiot tsukisima in kisuu as well
the fleas ere is a male

have you ever even sliced fruit
could the office not defeat it before the damage spread
legends of monsters

are you all right magistrate
im s sorry
im looking at them now
so wo ended up winning
youre using the sound of your wings to cast your illusions right
the fire
yup the best part of summer
dont imagine tat being on land will give you an advantage
my lord i beg your forgiveness
was probably an insects
hydrangea blossoms
edo would be flattened within a single night
give me but a word on how to use the mot fuji storm
genjuurou donors son
its been a long time
should the princess regain per entire power
come alone to miyamamura snort of town
those are just rumors tough
ever since tat day
tis means the promise you made as been broken
it will suck out all your blood
flowering wind style draw divine punishment
but the work of the moon group and those in the flower group
its useless
here i go aooni
someone is over there
hes amazing
tat a samurai can never lose
tis isnt the time
the weaters nice today
the job of arson and teft investigators is catching criminals
be not afraid people of kisuu
the insects
tsukisima style mot fuji meteor drop
insects magistrate officer tsukisima jinbei
every day from now on i will come to see jinbei
everything is to defeat sanada yukimura waiting inside the castle
it was almost certainly the insects magistrate
he cut clean troug it wit a saw
hes a criminal twos done many evil things in edo
the bloody beacon of the ten crucifix insects
they are ugly and weak only interested in flaunting their position
well done tenma
you climbed out of the eternal well from wick no one may return alive
your loyalty in protecting the princess even now
i ope not
i see
tis castle will soon fall to the enemy
my superiors tell me weve been unable to contact the province
it becomes my lifes greatest joy
koikawa donot didnt do it

and perform is duties in is steads
im not worth it
so you noticed me u
the exit is so close but insects are everywhere and no more buildings are falling
i didnt know there were so many

its nearly time for the summer fireworks of edo
a single moments weakness would cost my life
im going to quit being a ninja
im sure its difficult but we have another task at the moment

full power great yokodzuna slap

by the look of it you have tree days until the lavra overflows
but e hasnt admitted is guilt
wat do you mean
kill the insects magistrate
i asked you not to kill so often
were you
it cant be helped
is wat is left of a blade nearly twelve feet long
pulp texts recounting rumors and encounters between townspeople and insects
masiro would kick and swear at her until se died
we are the proud ten crucifix insects of sanada
these are the tougts of the insects connected to the servant
im a genius
even the minister treats im as an equal
youre going to tell me tis is wrong correct
if its the poison etats making you forget
one day my blade will repay the favor your blade as done for me
either her appearance nor her empty eyes
father took the blame
watch out
it took one of the girls
leave the rest to me
how our lord waits in oosaka
time for lunch
i see
always be ready for a fight
but why did you choose tat man to accompany you
ive beard tat theyre sometimes hired to take out the bugs
tis book is about the insects life cycle
its explosion will blow off my arms
run away while theres still time miss
theyre also allowed in the womens brat early in the morning
theyre a wandering group of mercenaries tat you can fire to fight insects
now you two
right
only a few use tat name
you have ten days to apprehend these people
tat means tonight is
the bear
your earths memories will go further back into the past
but even if they have se is destined to return to oosaka
when you ask someone something you need to name yourself first
tat was over a century ago
only someone very skilled could have cut like tat
mugai donors overwhelming strength makes those behind im feel safe
is tat peace booby woman trying to trick jinbei again
mizuno sama once asked mugai donot for an insects extermination
and afterward at hacijo island
isnt tat right
of course tat was the best they could do against my shadow
not bad
hes too fast
sum miss wat is the insects magistrate like
and being so mysterious is just another great thing about im
time out
munenao donot how will you atone for tis
everyone stay together
se was playing wit us like we were kittens
the front blade made it troug intact
my name is haru
a lot of people have cursed me
tis is my chance
hibaci donot if thats really you please name your ninjutsu style
well insects magistrate
tat it was the insects magistrate wo destroyed our village
so my mom and dead will be happy
the eternal insects cursed the clang of insects hunters and bated in their blood
f faster
black powder
full power slap
alongside my first rival
is tat all you have saved brother
if im going to be fighting bugs ive gotta be able to cut tis
f faster
ten crucifix insects yuri kamanosuke
but no one would believe a stupid story like tat
id love to ear about it
rino form
it was a foolish loyalty
records of the magistrate

cascade

you have such a pretty face
it takes flight in search of prey
jinbeis power awakens
but no one ere expects anything from you
kill my mother
big signing star
insects to call
the rokurou pair went to find the intruders and havent returned
they cut cleanly troug walls or iron doors
its to buy time for the snow group to complete its task
my task ends when the magistrate recovers her full power
theyre bolt stronger and touger than before
of course its a pathetic dealt one suited to a weakling
dont kill them before i get a chance
the king will soon awaken
youve left your middle exposed you fool
tis will be even more fun
summer war
if they find us now theyll think we were concealing stem
our task is still ahead of us
i sent im to finish der

ten four remain
why are you always causing problems
but thats fine
and it as cost much blood and pain before it was finished

you cannot beat me anywhere tat water flows
oaru donot are you safe

a group known as the insects hunters killed your mother
its the one way es like a normal old man
yes father
i am sorry faster
youre wit toe insects magistrates office
those big paper dolls yesterday were really cool
tis is the governments job
because you rid us of the bandits
but no normal human would change in such a way
including my comrades
to defeat the insects witing kisuu castle
but the water is my territory
so princess aah herself is beneath wakayama castle
hey tenma you take tis wimp
the breast of my king
we work for the insects magistrate fighting insects every day

agatomimaru donot were do you live
do you think the eternal well grants insects power without a price
damn it were did it go
at tis rate tsukisima will destroy himself
do you greet people properly wit justice
did tsukisima get lost
dont you want to see mugai kun fighting up close
jinbei kun dont be stupid

let me see it
when we were kinds we did everything together
my tea insects magistrates
but have you trained wit a blade iesige sama
hes more dedicated to the mission than any other insects hunter
and life flourishes everywhere
tis wall is so hard to climb
youre just so cool and gorgeous hibaci sand
o jinbei sama

wit you ere those insects men wont stand a chance
wat is tis

perhaps my friends have killed the insects magistrate by now
tis is the power of the ten crucifix insects
mother faster watch over me
i have no idea wat youre talking about
another insects nearby
can you tell me about the insects magistrates office
naturally
tis is the secret tecnique of edzu jinpaci of the ten crucifix insects
your parents wanted to see you after youd grown strong
d dont
id like to meet im
you can just stay back
not lying is the pat to justice
these are more than enough corpses
you may call us the rokurou pair
but i can say tis for sure
father
theres noting strange about her slaying a little rat tat opposes me
the magistrates servant will go wit yamagata and mugai donot
did you enjoy our combined insects attack
wat are you doing new kind
is something wrong
something lies ahead tat can restore the princesses power
ive never and so much fun tsukisima genjuurou
time for the morning meeting
you and mugai kun will be going
tsukisima style mot fuji storm
tat warmth still fills my heart
tat was about sixteen years ago
if you say protecting the small and the weak is wrong
o excuse me
mugai swan saved my life
ten ill take off tis fundosi
s stop it
by the way are the others in the mountains
they first appeared about a century ago
hydrangea blossoms
the fate of kisuu rests in the hands of you craftsmen
another one i see
my name is edzu jinpaci of the ten crucifix insects
the well is quite powerful
tenma remove anything tat blocks the evacuation route
ill lose my memories of tsukisima
it would be so much easier to simply lie there and die
always be ready for a fight
so sweet so kind
im trying to find out more on the insects magistrates office
the role of the tsukisima style mot fuji storm
our regenerative speed is five times faster
im disappointed you two never managed to functions as a pair
i must furry
and ten you trow away all ope
its so fast
thats the end
it isnt loyalty
damn it
tis clout keeps out the poison tat leaks from my body
y youre making fun of me
it must not fail because of your followers indiscretion
half a rinoceros beetles body is powerful muscle
its possible e did it
tokugawa iesige sama the next sogun
sorry we were actually eavesdropping
do you understand now jinbei kun
he took out all those insects at once
w wow
edzu is always so stiff
a group of powerful warriors
but the ten crucifix insects will not be defeated by mere rats
but for now ill forget tat
yes probably from is mothers side
our presence in kisuu is a secret
are you not working today
you heard them say
and during tat time jinbei was born
you must crush them to the end
how beautiful
a carpet
it took one of the girls
tat is why they gave me the position of insects magistrate
our goal lies right before us
up till now there as been much bloodshed in kisuu province
as samurai you should be ashamed
but for you to take interest in such a rat
thanks for sowing me the way too
five cannons bought wit my massive personal fortune
w wat is tis
just around tat corner ten go straight

an insects
i havent fought nearly enough
i might know just the place
ten prepare for your destruction
youre as good as ever mugai kun
cinpou style bug blasting smoke
agatomimaru donot are you hurt
tsukisima style mot fuji storm
and im going to get my scoop
you would rob your men of their chance for glory
jinbeis power awakens
his mother okiku was a kind woman far too good for sanosuke
its okay to be alone
youre pretty good
miss i wont die ere
i know if someone and told me tat story id never have believed it
my rival is female ninja hibaci

you saw it didnt you my perfect body
those two said they had plans today they just left
thanks to im you have no ideaow hard it was for me to even make friends

i crossed everything out and threw it away
well thats because its precious
im getting a bad feeling
hey onodera morning
o yea

each pair as to old hands no matter wat
good thing tis girls toe densest ever

its the perfect place to pounce on someone
i had no idea you were so bold
se already mastered tat ability as a kind
im not quite sure how we ended up together
yea he couldnt stop nagging about some stupid stuff before the race
you cant hide from us anymore
and besides we just might see the good in each other for the first time once weve become husband and wife
its going to be
by my side
you in any state to climb it tough
wouldnt you want im to know after you went troug the trouble to fix it
are you fine wit some tea
man lady luck is on my side after all im so gonna savor tis
have you seen tis pendant before yesterday
whats up wit tat wat toe ell are you talking about
is something the matter
i know enough to figure sometings wrong
but weve got to do tis
five minutes to curtain
and i cant afford to lose
gimme number
my mothers japanese and my fathers american
i barely bumped into you
in case you forgot our relationship is just an act
it was another day of boredom for me in my hospital room
w wat now
wanna go check and see twos right
i want to talk to you about wat happened yesterday
hey darling you dropped something
for ten years even
so thats wat happened
if it ever gets out tat you came into the girls bait to peep on us
at long last the main event of the evening
hey honey
icijou kun said tat it was a misunderstanding
well my father always calls me marie so snuff
youll promise not to talk to me at school
obviously it does its completely different when its romantic
way to go you stupid gorilla
hes like a model
tis might be the only chance ill get to set things straight
were talking about kissing on the lips not your goddamn cheeks
and tat se is bound by spurious love
i know its embarrassing to have a classmate see us like tis
i wonder if kosaki got herself a loves knot
theres something i want to tell you
the truth is i didnt even find out tat i was engaged until yesterday
youre just filled wit energy like a bean sprout darling
tis is a huge misunderstanding
like youve ever been kissed
and confirm the truth
caught a cold
i know were ere to study for exams but we also have some english omework to knock out
youre a hundred years too young for tat
and it doesnt sound like se dates im or anything
did it go well wit my father
overcome tat hurdle and find happiness
if thats the case ten were just going to have to wait for your locket to come back from repairs
did something happen
thats exactly it
you want to take a break or something
the two of you got along great when you were kinds
ten eyd it couldnt be any simpler just tell her now you feel
ive never even been in love ever
wait whys it doing tat
citoge can and the rest wo lost at rock paper scissors are cleaning up
everything ive been waiting for is there
its hard enough trying to strike up conversation wit a blonde beauty like her
hey you better not be undressing me in your dirty mind any further
given wat se said and the whole setup there
these physical changes seem to come about only under certain conditions
you eat way too much meat you know
from ten years ago
so you two made up u
about kissing and whatnot
you noticed too
theyre all posted on the board
so es been training tat hard to get stronger to protect kirisaki u for ten whole years
fxte sound of voices far away
wat you were the one wo just said tat we do
for some reason onodera as the same vibe as the girl from my memories
you yelp old ladies you dont know look for things no matter how long it takes
youre right
miyamoto im begging you please believe me
i mean considering youre in all of them
and not a word to anyone else
or of your promise
i dont know why se dates me so much
if youre just gonna complain ten give it back
a all right juliet
well guess its impossible to teach someone to swim in a day
whats gotten into her all of a sudden
wat do you mean female barbarian
its totally obvious tat youre madly in love
it was totally the press conference from ell
wo knew you were afraid of lightning too
when did you and kirisaki swan get so close
of course im totally willing
even if it was a promise made ten years ago
bringing me back little things youd found on the mountain as souvenirs and showed me such a good time
but not tis time u
id prater go home soaking wet taen sacre an umbrella wit you
you uncle
we went out together today it was fun
still onoderas acute as a button
going to mickey ds wit everyone after school im so excited
he makes dinner for is family every single day
well yea
or are you planning to take over our organization
m morning onodera zum are you okay
its a four andkercief tearjerkerand its a current blockbuster
hey now
hey my bad o im so sorry
you know like your father said
maybe shed be interested in talking about sports
se went to the science prep room
im sure
and you were always the kind of person whod come come wit a smile on her dirt smeared face
milady is something wrong
why not its just some girl talk
i was so relieved when it turned out you were okay
onodera im sorry but the play
these past few days ive hardly even gotten near kirisaki at all
have you ever heard tat phrase
youre not much of a man
the last piece is still missing
i have no idea wat youre talking about
woa hey old up
you guys never change do you
so out of respect for our students autonomy
tough tat was the last time we saw each other
wat kind of locker room key looks like tat anyway
ten etats wat the key is for
but se remembered zawsze in love and all
seisirou dont shower standing up
the fake couple tat bated each other
his butt
tat means onoderas the girl i met ten
just kidding
wat kind of misunderstanding
its fine so come on
wat depresses me is your kindness
so the duels invalid
i heard tat everyone was raving about our class
all right i just need to settle down for now
wat toe ell waits wit tis girl
how wheres the tanuki
when i walked to school e escorted me there
have you seen tat person around our school before
tsugumi swan you look uncomfortable wit japanese style baths
wait tat voice
geez i already apologized so why dont you just forgive me
how we call each other by our last names even tough weve been dating for a while
its not like we had an obligation to go troug wit it anyway
made you want to switc places u
i take thee at thy word
did you have a fight
yea tat we might actually be fated for each other
right raku heres one you might like
young master young master you have a visitor
if it falls its love it just might be
and wave my and troug the empty air
back in the day we often ate our meals just like tis
whats the matter youre totally helpless arent you
but the two of them really dont check out
ses my girlfriend i wont let anyone else gave her
whos more important me or her
all right everyone listen up
my only choice now is to pour all my heart into making you fall for me
considering wat happened two days ago
hey we were supposed to meet up ages ago
so wat happened to the whole duel sting
and fyi ive kissed lots of different people
you think ses a half
wait a minute se told me ses never had any friends or boyfriends

for example mikage was a deity of marriage
is tomoe kun coming again today

o se woke up

yea and es at my school right now
and so the festival ended wit a magnificent finale
hearing prayers

yonomori sama likes team quite a lot
i remember it looking like it was going to fall apart
a being tat knows mikage out of friendship
hes down there
momozono swan were did you get tat money
and as a result mizuki donors sake is first class
make sure youre ready
i told you tat you could have fun
yes tat is but one of the land gods powers
whats tis chill down my spine
the human
ekota sand
i remember now
im at the buds stop in the forest
if you were to live there it would take a weight off my back
haa tat was a weird dream
now take your clothes off and let me see
it seems es busy wit work tis week
i bet you girls are super popular at school
the beac and the ocean are breeding grounds for evil
your rome matters doesnt it
anami can
the duties of the land god
im not scared of snakes you know
and thus shrine familiars are bound by such words
yonomori sama please look
h how do you and anami know each other again
anami sama thank you so much
he surely as a plan
im keeping the miasma back as best as i can
d do you want to try
anami are you hurt
hur looks like im missing
once in a while we do have worsippers come pay their respects
seriously arent girls these days much too bold
should otonasi and i drop down
outing will be solved wit sentimental arguments
were going to it run play defense and sweat the sweat of youth
damn it
and we can all say goodbye to tis world
the operation start time is
therefore as their representative otonasi kun
you all obtained souls wit the right to become god
but why are you all ere
i have developed tease muscles to play baseball
sometings strange
and e wouldnt yell at me either
at least were participating right
hang on a minute
se wanted to call forth a powerful attack
you look noting like any kind of dancer and you look way too happy
hey now watch your language
man it still looks scary
everyones trying their hardest so they dont have to do a punishment game more fearsome than death
well you asked me to prove to you tat no one could die
ill be living in a new morning
hearing your story it just made sense
ses the same as us
takeyama kun well leave the computer to you
but does tat justify those actions
ive always walked alone
i have no regrets over wat as been born
it was a grand battle
the one before tat was the it doesnt feel like im alive battlefront
yea lets do tat
im a little worried so ill go talk to the upperclassmen
ten we couldnt replenis ammo or replace any broken weapons
ive always walked alone
do you know girls dead monster are amazing
you should die once
there was never anyone but my father and brother
are you sure
o looks like all the warfront teams are advancing
but tat kinda makes me happy
therefore allow me to grant peace to you all
but if se isnt a creation of god an angel
but now tat we dont have an enemy
they were arguing about an answer
i see
were going to pick up food from there
youre too noisy
and to buy presents for my younger sister
its a software tat can create and alter the materials of tis world
and ten more life was lost right before my eyes
as members of the barnacle extinction guard battlefront
youre strong arent you yuri
ten a few days later
were past tat time
we never and a chance to find out
se didnt resign but was discharged
we wont be able to pull off any big operations during the ball game tournament wit the band in tis state
and ten get driven into the ceiling
clear
wo else other than you could i possibly be accepting right now
se as passion at least
yea im well aware of tat
time to really play baseball guys
wat are you doing stop resting and hurry up
whats going on you guys are going for the king
right now is when people are either busy wit clubs or reading some
operation start
are you serious
theres no way to win tis
its a miracle
i repeat hurry up you morons
tat doesnt look like it was easy to make
from now on solitary action is prohibited
to enter ere safely you need a passprase
tat was an irreplaceable experience
im weeding among other things
i dont remember clearly
so anyway ill be confiscating your guitar for a while
were se lives
so wat kind of traps are there
move it you two
yea etats gross cut it out
why do you think i put you in ere
listen to me ses not our enemy anymore
wat an idiot
maybe get some air
o yea
i see
im not supposed to take it seriously
my brother died
tis isnt a warfront were acting more like a ministry
angels getting up
crazy baby
old guild
but when tis is all over
girls dead monster u
ses only using hand sonic right now
youre so weak youre out of the question
im gonna go get my guitar back
we dont directly cause any arm to them
something dangerous is coming
maybe weve been in tis world for too long
hows tis
a pop fly went to second base
ten come to the courtyard
well always be together just like lovers
version
man im far too
for drinks weve got maybe pet bottles of tea and water
sprint when youre on the move
isnt it about time you call me
the clones can use hand sonic and distortion
all the time ive spent planning
i want to remember again
and fourth is you
thats how our memories were made
even siina swan fell prey to a trap
its the programmer himself
isnt se just desperate for action since we cant do anything right now
otonasi swan being the exception of course
thats right your memories
well be going wit everyone present ere
ive been getting complaints about noise from the other clubs
lets do some prop wrestling
i see
weve abandoned the guild
anyway aoi shouldnt you be free of regrets at tis point
god doesnt exist anywhere
we dont even have enough time to organize our resistance
so basically es an idiot too
you were reminded of the sound of your own eartbeat
but wait wat lies beyond tat
so wait tease guild guys are doing tis even tough they know were ere
well ooyama kun suffered a deep enough wound to is earth
ses got way too many interests
and all her answers were making fun of the teachers
if they keep tis up well win
my brother had been so far ahead of me
you wont get yurippes attention by just being strong you know
o way
im just joking wit you dont take it so seriously
and safely recover the original tensi
right
were only eating
maybe id be your friend in tis world
how we just need her to use harmonics again
understood tonight ten
its natural to feel a little upset after your memories return
is tat all youve got
we all have memories of being alive
you must be an idiot
wat happens if you touch tat
its well known within the warfront tat those wove been subject to your penalty games
i guess
yea we cant just stop making weapons
ten seconds
wat do you mean yuri
the current tensi is different from the old one
tat an anti angel trap
out of tis world
turns out hinata got zero points
you have some excellent obbies for a young person
and carefully fasten my necktie
according to the armorys reports
you changed into tat uniform and came ere to take classes
yay i beat ii sand
hang on a minute
o god no budda nor angels exist
i want to be wit you
thanks for your concern
a tis is big
youll definitely be next
fuckin crazy
stop ignoring me
and how did you make a propulsion engine in the first place
ses weak
your team is not registered to play
we already contracted toe guild so well be fine
yea how would it be okay if you dont get more weapons
i cant get enough of her murderous riffs
listen up everyone each of you will gather people up and form a team
or maybe troug the window
dont underestimate my skills
cell pones wont work either
the live concerts started
any others
yea sounds like im gonna get killed
yurippe is serious
if se as a human soul like us
if we start doing normal club activities would we be satisfied
matsusita kun and tk look too heavy
i dont want to rely on my parents
if we can save the original
wat about oda kun
thats how well meet
its too dark to see the ball anymore today
its almost like im the bad guy
maybe id be your friend in tis world
ses totally underestimating me
something everyone will notice
wat about food
didnt angel erase der
rumors tat angel got all zeros on all the tests
if you do it just like tat you wont need to fly
o todays operation will be monster stream
and se wasnt able to follow the stories properly
hey wit all tis we wont have to use tornado for a while right
come on thats no good at all
the diversionary squad as been suppressed
thats why well be together in the end too
even a jewelry store would be fine
well be gathering food from there
but kanade would never become overwhelmed wit suck offensive instincts
the traps will only slow her down
if tis were a real army everyone would be dead
its a thinner form for gig speed maneuvers
hur really
its like the end of a carnival
its against the school code to go near twere since its dangerous
o no thats simply a rule
dont worry youll remember things soon enough
the time as finally come
the machine just came from the computer room
and our outfield is cramp too
just sow us any suspicious data takeyama kun
and one younger brother
im super strong
our emergency ammunition stocks will be depleted soon
its my turn
a one on one pk game good enough
thatll only happen if my concentration breaks
my ears
humans
wasnt your life also real to you
how violent is angel
im not certain yet
wat do you mean by tat
ill bring up the next issue ten
alrigt lets just use my ypnotism to find out
hand sonic version
battle
but the odds are not zero
all my dreams are being scattered
se should go inform him tatsometing strange is happening
wat is it akamura
the same and just so you know pcs never age
eventually going so far as to create weapons
you hang on until the end
i never realized it
i felt nauseous
however you people create weapons out of earth
damn it
wat an idiot
the time when you were alive before tis world
when you find her get her to use harmonics immediately
and relax ill drop you at an easy point
you mean there might be or more
i felt like collapsing
ill always keep mine like tis as hardened as steel
i cant forget it
while you remain in the battlefronts headquarters ere youre safe
could it be a bug
wat an idiot
isnt anyone close to her
damn you you trying to run
thats a joke right
fair and square
we now begin the final match of the tournament
like i care
ill steal tis goal if it kills me
losing the trust placed in her and being stripped of her position
home run
wow everyone seems smarter than usual today
alrigt pick a good time during their practice and go
whats tat all of a sudden
indeed tease muscles are for me to better learn
is tat enough
whats tat supposed to mean
clones were positioned all over the guild lying in wait
like tis world would allow it
yurippe wat is tis operation about
playing an analogy game is good too tough
by the way im in charge of monitoring tensi so im out of the operation
cant you pick a old or something tat seems remotely possible
okay fine
all it was was me hitting the ceiling and ten dropping to the floor witing seconds
wat o way
hurry up we need to get going now
its still just following the order of the main body
thank you for coming today
so we can actually facilitate a conversation
are you sure your brain didnt melt and drain out of your nose
concordantly se will be returning to her former position as student council president
it wouldnt be good to lose our forces all at once ere
youre gonna become tensis pet and go rest in peace right
well ask tk next
rounds mine once i get past tis
i was mostly guessing but yea
in the war of the french revolution in symbol of the special ranks
and above all they have iwasawa sank on vocals and guitar
do they dress up the things
ever since tat day
were counting on you again
u dwy would you ask me tat
takamatsu kun your report please
theres noting for me to do down there anyway
you wanna walk troug all team traps
thinking about something
se is one ell of a tomboy
should we go for soccer next
it really is a total mystery wat you were before you died
im the leader after all
o time to worry about tat
just put lots of stupid answers on it
hand sonic version
if her soul isnt made of steel
toilet paper etats about to be flushed away realize
youll get as much dirt as you want if you spoke around the walls
second contact bridge
so i can laugh loving tis foolishness
their absolutely exquisite form
the most natural conclusion is tat tensi as made a new skill but
we will protect tis aniwa
tat would take too much time
it sounds good to digest food
all wit a single pat on the back
angel area infiltration
theres two hinata kuns
the reason her other self sprang forth is tat
tat means ill have to get out there as first battery
tis time ses saying well be able to fight troug sports fair and square
thats pretty far from tensi
game set
and playing so fair too
the mans kneeling and crying is eyes out
points iger and its a cold game
i continued on in order to live
her weakness is her love for acute things
to god
and ten swallowed up by the ground
lets do tis before se activates per guard skill
thats wat i tougt
the one twos always lifting is glasses to speak intelligently is takamatsu kun
tis menu item is surprisingly good
so es holding them ostage and using them as sields
is tat true yuri
youre on the verge of death
it looked to me like you were just being absent minded
the power ses fought the sss wit until now
doesnt tat make us friends
but its a physics test
saw damn youll win it all hisako
and anyway theres no one in tis world wo died by suicide
the twists and turns of time will change
tat person became aware of the bugs in tis world and began to amend stem
tis body of mine
the final match one point difference
wat barnacles are edible
wat are you trying to say all of a sudden
in the end it seemed shed be happy wit anything
soccer
our comrades are making weapons there
your life was real too
the tears tat have fallen
o guild used their own judgment and resent toe traps
it was a simple fly ball to second
just tis morning se stabbed me till my guts were hanging out
also call me cri
well tis is a school after all
even in tis world
idiot
its a place we abandoned long ago
why would someone wo committed suicide bother fighting
so whats our current problem ten
im not too confident about having her on lead vocals for girls dead monster
didnt we form tis warfront starting wit just the two of us
dont go off and leave kanade can behind
you mean well eat tis every day
but in the end its impossible
aoi ayato wasnt an pc
is kanade alrigt
okay im detonating toe guild
and ended up wandering into tis world
we all and terrible lives right
tat girl ses always so energetic
hurry to the shelter
listen and judge for yourself
thats right why dont you just go away
maybe ill ask for kanades opinion
hes a simplistic guy wholl only take orders from yurippe
he knows tat we wont attack the regular students
memories of living as best we could
its a little unfair but lets ask the leader like matsusita
wa wait a minute wat do you mean
we didnt manage to get anything tis time either
there are no traps left hurry
help will definitely arrive so we just have to old out till ten
were playing tis guerrilla style anyways
even tough life is so unfair
im the student council vice president aoi
its a place deep underground tat we call guild
so youve found a purpose
so tensi strictly obeys tis worlds rules
otonasi kun aoi kun
but wed need a carpet bombs to take care of all those
the number of teams just keeps on increasing
tensi isnt harmless anymore
se gets per band together inside the school
sound like tis
if se needs to use the same methods as we do
excuse me but youre interfering wit class
hey dont just stand there go find the original
river
everyones out partying late at night
oak shall we go to the field
tis is guild
i want to stay wit you from now on
among the pcs theres others just like us
ten lets use my ypnotism to
well be participating of course
are you serious
its name is operation tornado
the one wo keeps saying how unwise is siina sand
damn it its all in english
there was hardly anything to eat there
love as developed in tis world
im amazed youre able to ask such a stupid question
so we need seven more people
having a fun academy life
king of the river
is tis guy in gig school too
looks like last times traps havent been resent lucky
lets work together
beginning analysis
the traps moving
how could it be its studying
go o a week of fasting
is the fighting going to end
wit the power of tis system
not really its just
ive searched for the detention room we were confined in
your character as definitely broken down
youre sort on members right
o my we actually agree for once
why is there another
after tat i became paralyzed
se ado ope in her life
eventually everyone will be alone
we have no choice but to submit
we usually see monster stream as a sign of the kings anger
if thats how youd like to interpret it im okay wit tat
in the end even is glasses came off
tis isnt a damn school festival
thats not wat i meant at all im talking about the team
i cant erase it
thats the part i dont like
oda just roused ere and defeated it
o run to her and dug per tight
wouldnt tat be such a pleasant new life
i prefer to conduct myself peacefully as much as possible
cant you do something about tat broom
such childs play
how much does tis guy love fishing
well save you soon
i see thats good
w wait is tis just simple river fishing
exercise the utmost vigilance
why doesnt tensi get her powers from god
does tis make me look acute
o yea etats wat it was
wat the bells wit those guys
baseball is the way right now
okay ten heres the last question
angel is developing her own powers herself
now theres two of tat ferocious tensi
o ses a clone too
having lived for people other than themselves
tat girl was making fun of me
you know you were being targeted by a gun
kanade means to play a song right
time out
i was able to find fulfillment in my previous life
its a total mystery wat you were doing before you died
thats the second problem
ordinary students have never sent us to the reflection room before
i had siblings
aoi kuns ypnotism is the real deal
so wat youre trying to accomplish ere is to wipe toe data
next is ooyama kun
thats the last piece iwasawa left behind
even if there were theyd just disappear
please do
good ten battlefront teams are all winning
the dream called happiness ill grant it for sure
our objective is to obliterate tensi
the ex deputy president andcurrent vice president suggested it to her
now even while we face tis danger
they were obviously after money
could you give me some time
the guilds decision was correct
actually ive already joined takeyamas team
i dont care battlefront
dont think the me today will be the same as the me tomorrow
ga its true
o fighting
wait wat kind of punishment game is tat
because of you the band is dying
yea wat were they are they monsters
watching tv or playing games alone is more fun
i messed up it was just a toyyyyyyy
like tat do everything in high tension
home run
it was the finals of the regional tournament
lets go exercise tis off
thats the sole remaining place for us
a home run
alrigt etats decided ten
impossible
its ypnotism
these guys make weapons ere
they were saying youre an angel or something
we will now commence the graduation ceremony
tat sounds like im gonna die
are you talking about a game world
tis is just a normal girls room
my fingertips are so cold they feel like theyll chip off
and these arent exactly easy to just make off wit
as long as you know the composition and structure of the object
theres people tat will stay wit you
right now
thats some popularity alrigt
just wo do you think you are
if you go it might be fun
tat guy needs to go on a diet
a they can even be used as replacements for paperclips
could you be a bit more quiet in tat corner there
thats right
well be fine if we leave out center and have right and left cover the middle ground
we have no choice but to obey im
we need her power to protect them
keeping your head clean is basic ygiene
well fire as we fall back
waiting seconds is kinda long
guard skill delay
will a coward like im really be useful
well if you and them youd look more like an angel right
is tat the original
but all sorts of things
aoi ayato wasnt an pc
its time to settle tis once and for all
why cant i do it under seconds
not without some trouble tough
hey otonasi kun i was thinking
thats good
instead of an angel youre more like a devil now
go to class and pretend to pay attention
but her dream was granted in tis world

its written like to tie a string
ill listen to all those feelings
guard skill distortion
were abandoning tis place
the wind blows troug the days spent just like tis
i did it
ill assist you
however tis world cant become such a place
for her to take all tat consciousness in at one time
a wind tat blows past everyday life
dont you know the story of the boy wo cried wolf
if youre looking to create things from earth theres a mountains worst
w wat is tat
my only worry

the number of teams just keep increasing
it is now time for the second punic war sensei
hey etats yurippes voice
i cant force it on someone else
wat you need right now is

so theyre all just trying to be trendy
ill be a wonderful dream

the hinata team as won in the third pinning by cold game
the way things are now were sounding pretty awful
hmp youve finally come u
the poor thing
time out
holding us up in tis isolation cell looking place
and theres even more after we go stopping
o worries
youre bleeding from your forehead
tis was a place to save young souls
our next operation will be the revenge of the angel area invasion plan
how our outfield and back are perfect
stupid etats way too big
not at all
rebelling against their former lives
is tis its range
even clones avez consciousness
thatll lower per scores to the lowest of the school
tis is why i was born
but if tat began to blossom wat would happen to tis world
even hinata if red caught tat fly ball to second
can you really live there all by yourself
marriage
if the student council president ado wings it would increase per prestige
yea very
getting us to go to class is important
all stand
isnt tat my line
basically es another dumbass
do you know wo else to get for the rest of the team
tensi will be more alert than the last time
i wish theyd bolt disappear
ten they dont have any self awareness
principals office
its a promise right
theyre at the infirmary standing guard
well religion is a human thing to begin wit
even in tis garden of learning how fast these years have gone by
youre not scared
just now big is it
do you remember when we infiltrated tensi area
we went tat far
you will now have a happy dream
tis is the entrance
its a little inelegant
the ultimate happiness for a woman
we have formed a team for the student council
its a skill tat splits ones body into two
tis is a pretty big school
ever mind tat wheres angel
pretty much all the battlefront members are already on a team
but the ones tat attacked us were all warlike and rutless
any team wick performs worse than the regular students
a judo old souled work
and to seize tis world
ses a candidate for the girldemo lead vocals position
tat isnt supposed to exist in tis world
the test is about to start
are you awake now
home game set
we cant resupply our weapons either
its too dangerous alone
wow its so pretty
i shouldnt think about it
whats your given name
its so pretty
wings
in tat case why not just destroy the machine itself
and the teachers
only one
god awaits ahead
time out
i see
and were are the adults
wait kanades been wit me the entire time
kanade tacibana swan will be resigning as student council president
i know tis is out of the blue but could you join our force
dont cut off a budding young flower wit vague comments like tat
aim for her foot thatll at least stop her from ceasing after you
youve already joined takamatsus team
id love to study
we also wouldnt have an ending like tis
head to a place etats more open
wat kind of match is it going to be wit you folding tat broom
his glasses
w waits strange
start
but the taste tat comes afterwards is
it seems tat the strength of ones feelings could one day return ones humanity
it looked like you were having fun when you were writing the letters out
tat teams scaring me
dont be an idiot if you wait alone the shadows will get you
were eating
at any rate wat kinda sick joke is tat
i have noting to say to im
they still need time to think
even ten my life can be used for the sake of another person
the words of acceptance
also call me
tree bouts change
do you know wat youve done
is to buy enough time to recover all my memories
if we fail we dont get to eat for a whole week
but you still suffer from the memories of your past life
alrigt lets go
damn it
tat toe me wo made tat promise to you was the one to wake up is a miracle
but the last part is sad
cruel but irreplaceable
it could be ten or twenty or more
so your members are all in the baseball club
since when were you in charge
i want to live forever
are you alrigt is your body okay
the vocals screamed for me
they had fought back for so long
confess to tensi
im sleepy
you are aware tat girls dead monster is a rock band correct
its just an example theyre honor students wo exist in tis world to begin wit
just looking at you wit clothes on is more than enough
tis will be my first time asking a girl out
did se fall prey to tensi
all you need to do is act stupid and go flying
friends
youre going to rest in peace now
in other words they can use harmonics too
the name of the force changes often
an angel is suitable for fighting tat sting
you also suffer the pain of the memories from when you were alive
o you did a great job as leader
they were rebelling against god
im not a brat
enlist
i dont get it
even for someone like me wo died no better than a piece of trash
guard skill howling
tat wat you want lets go
behold the power of her beloved szecuan tofu
isnt e just a normal student
my parents were always fighting
along wit some teammates wo can help translate toe manual
playing in a band is more youthful taen playing baseball
for my brother it would have been noting but a disappointment
im truly jealous
every day was as fun as a cultural festival
the evacuations complete
there was no yelping it wit is build
its not just you
well leave deactivating toe traps to you
i was confident it would pass
really
you get a special seat
were down to four now
lets sow everyone wo as the better baseball skills between you and im
and they are trying to lead the organization in a new direction
were all the traps along the way are still functioning the most dangerous place
dont be ridiculous
it was impossible from the start
just follow each others lead understood
hey is it really okay to take up the whole gym like tat
you wanna play a serious game
do you know the story of the boy wo cried wolf
i mean will you be obliterated if we win tis game
yea but ses still kinda the student council president

wat could their goal possibly be
sorry yuris a little emotionally unstable
we blew it up along wit tensi
kanade would never point a sword at us
actually im surprised you guys dont even know her name
just like the name of the operation tat things a monster
dont stop dancing
thats right start by looking for an adult
o etats unlikely
o yea
more importantly the shadows are multiplying
not only for the teachers but we also caused trouble for the pcs
wat are you so excited over some persimmons for
staff building rd floor unused room
it seems you still dont understand
for the time being for engaging in activities past curfew
we need to get the enemy right in front of us
before tat happens hurry up and get out of ere
ball game tournament
se also and a airs life
there are some tat are edible
wat more are you planning to do
ive never and one myself
or rather you can tell just by looking at it
youre horrible you know tat
the band is dying because of your guitar playing
i refused to go back to those lonely days
so you said you and a report
i wont forgive any slip sups
hes a fucking prest
if only we could have gotten away wit just faking it in class
theres no replacement for iwasawa sang and yuri
how they can leave tis world in peace
tat would be the greatest irregularity so far if so im sure sell wake up
i could even beat tensi
a little over students
your line of reasoning just now is melting and dripping out of your nose
youve done more than enough
all right tat was an excellent love song damn it
im taking on a mission wit extreme risk ere
the guild as been appraised of the situation
im not really worried about becoming a water fleas
in other words we can get by wit one victim per tensi
ive been lying on tat armd floor for so long my neck is killing me
tis is a very happy situation
their music is wat keeps us going please
right
my body must have been able to save someone
maybe i should just bust toe computer up
wat are you doing at tis time of day
well youre next takamatsu kun
listen can you even do a bridge
its settled now
everyone make your way to the old guild
we need reinforcements
ill be waiting on the soccer field after school
well replenis supplies as quickly as possible
se must have used tat skill harmonics
itll quickly turn into a blood stained battle just like yesterday
okay break time
now close your eyes
how would one confirm such a thing
i felt nauseous
against angel
yurippe swan you sound like a villain
but if the guilds locations is discovered and overtaken
you seem to have some interesting values
but maybe thats why everyone followed me
it looks like you changed the program u
all meaning to my life
were tailspin flight friends
thats right
i dont really get it
sorry ill be leaving you alone again
its because of tat tat we have the right to become god
we wo have known true pain in life are the only ones wo have the right to become god
its finally ere
really
can you buy me some time
lets always be together
hearing my fathers angry voice every day
prepare yourself
tat girl isnt an angel
most likely se summoned it unconsciously
get seven runs in and itll be a cold game
does the culprit sneak in at night and load team onto a cart or something
tis is the girls dorm
roger
and you see theres a girl in tat dark corner wit lonely eyes
se looks the part at least
o right lets get tk to teach us how to dance
oda kun likes to stress the importance of the moment
if i could live forever
well arent beaten so easily
wat does tat mean
were out of time get out ere on the field
of course tis is a normal school after all
ive always walked alone
does tis mean am i going to be obliterated
vacantclassroomclassroom building a
my father became bedridden
even tough its all so important to me
their numbers increasing must mean
hes actually an idiot
how ten tow might angel be feeling about tis
tis is enough for tis dream
its our turn at last
ultimately it must be to make us completely obedient
past the fence of course
there were two bouts runners on second and third bases
and disappearing from tis world
hey is it all right to be talking at a place like tis
im still so powerless
to think we still have no tread to lead us to god
hmp girls are always like tat
eating during rest ours is against the rules
your scouts are getting louder but your its arent going any further
we cant contact the outside
wat should we do
and tat was enough for you to serve as a leader
my brother died
tat compassion was wat kept me visiting der
i was such a deadweigt
everyone from the sss put their lives on the line to come save you
it was made to handle even the king of the river
in the end
was it love
and the lyrics too theyre surely about iwasawa sand
u yes go ahead
but instead ses just eating and living so simply
if you wait alone the shadow will get you
we hadnt done anything wrong
wat is tis operation
honestly you all are a group of blockeads
wait a second dont decide things on your own
doesnt anyone have a better idea
ive been waiting for tat time to come
hurry to the old guild and let everyone know
so you dont have any memories
ive always loved you
im looking forward to making friends too
the fasting yurippe mentioned includes water
ses just enforcing it
yea im sure ill be a fan again
ill start learning to care for you
ten of course sell skewer you right troug your heart
thats pretty stupid
those wo are eaten by one lose their soul
we couldve done so much more
why are there two now
someone should have checked it
arent we the ones wo need help
it was a really important game
listen youll be part of the barricaded group tat will inibit tensis interference
a list of students
how ten wo wants to cry next
thats the ticket tensi bought
say tat again
thats not something the leader should say
wont you be lonely
the team tat advances will be the one tat beats us
ten im sure sell go and try to make contact
itd be a joke if my problems could be solved so easily
thats wat pisses me off the most about you
wow an idiot
note the sss sort for sinda sekai sensen aka toe afterlife battlefront
there are monsters ere in tis world
tat is possible
but kanade is our ally
next aoi ayato
wings
you idiot
wait time seconds
the complete opposite of the cool beauty laura tat iwasawa add
at least as far as ive seen
lets have lunch
should we go after angel
dont think too hard about it
wat do you think youre grabbing
do you love im or ate im
wat kind of peaceful resolution are you going to offer us
baseball
it is time for the edict against cruelties to living things
so they make the weapons ere
version
we would absolutely never threaten ordinary students wit numbers or power
roger
the training was intense
incidentally even if you get cut into pieces youll return to normal after a while
working a job tat learns me just enough to eat
any teachers
he couldnt spin the wheel any more
our idiot count increased
at tis point it doesnt even matter if se uses distortion
hand sonic version
he became a precious sacrifice
o way
really youre not an angel
move it you two
full swing
wat an idiot
those ghostly things have never been in tis world before
little girl youre the eldest
it is absurd
tis is the world of the afterlife
if ooyama swan had been left alone it wouldve been dangerous
wheres everyone else
its possible it was a different magazine
theyre on the verge of extinction
thats fine just say you wanna become a pilot
has there ever been a time when things have gone tis far outside angels plans
guard skill distortion
tis world is in my hands
they must have told you were the valuables are
those wo attacked us won
hur wait thats not right at all
he should be able to get back your lost memories
were enjoying the school life
thats right
really
a life like tat was enough
you know were the important things are in tis louse donca
sure kill guillotined murder sot
so wat kind of program was it
yuri nyansans fans i guess
ive always walked alone
stop thinking up stupid stuff and help out
even since tat day ive kept tis broom balanced on my fingertip
dammit wat do i do
world history
well head for old guild ten
im okay
ill start going to your house every day
either way im a failure
did you guys eat something strange
the logical conclusion from tat is were in the worst possible setup
i want to be wit you
altoug we will experience the pain of it
are you the villain
raise your hands
hows tis
it was eaten
same as back ten
o one would ask im to join the team
im currently running a big speed password cracking program
like her name like the sound of a note being played
im talking about the team
tat bastard
so its not just two
thats not true
the takamatsu team lost by cold game
were confiscating all these instruments
its not tat youre any different
you stabbed me troug the heart and killed me
im obviously making up for your incompetence
well it took some time but
ooyama kun your seats behind hers to her left etats pretty close isnt it
so even if its expensive ill get you whatever you want
ill give you some meat udon come and help out
thats the spicy szecuan tofu its famous for nobody ever ordering it
but have your match at the proper place
if se as a human soul same as us ten
wat a blunder
dont steal my lines old lady
well its nothing bad
suma sensei is such a nice person
right aka chain
its such an easygoing day today
my name is iseshima aya
where has miko being taken to
platonic heart is not a baseless lie
you have been exceptionally been accepted as having the right to join platonic heart
ththats my line
you are that person from earlier on
to obediently let me put you down or choose to resist and that boy blow up like a bombs
become friends with us
hey miko theres no need to cry
but how i havent won the platonic heart yet
two choicest pick one
sorry to disappoint you but we are not in the sky
you have earned the right to participate in platonic heart
natsume you are too conscious about such things
a fight but why at a place like this
you should listen to the arrangements of the stewardess on board a planed
theres a gems somewhere in the world known as the platonic heart
what you heard from in the past may be just a rumor
youre always happy and youre so cool thats totally awesome
im not really clear about the granting of wishes or anything related
this sure feels kind of strange
what is hell is this platonic heart anyway
with this we are officially friends
dear iseshima aya sama
it also counts as a graduation from platonic heart
then the reason for this money is
what so your mother is a hand to hand combat specialist
thats my name
who exactly is the person instructing miko and the others to join this
if you prevail your wish will be granted
its all because its so easy to see through you
because in this world theres nothing that cant be resolved with the help of money
next on is the final phase to landing please be prepared
here these are the preparatory amount that i have kept for you
you cant youre always unaware about these things
its only natural that if you win your wish of any kind will pretty much be granted
who was the one who sent the mail
this this is ridiculous
to be honest it was that attendants fault
hey guest
in addition shes also a beauty with a great body
and to obtain this piece of gems you need to undergo ruthless challenges
kazuki miko sama is
to think that you actually joined platonic heart for such a silly reason
miko its me aya
whats with what are you doing
natsume are you alright
if you guys want to play its fine with me but dont forget about your studies
although its a little bit of a side tracked route for me
im sorry are you alright
thats rather surprising
but you owe it to that to be able to gain entry to platonic heart
this is miko chain
im used to it already
if you obtain it it will grant any wish you make
guest the planed is about to land
platonic heart receiving complete
your wish to be able to make friends has already been received
even if you tell me that
fighting in those weird costumes
dont spout some stupid lines like you coward
thats only a rumour
im also completely clueless about that
will it really work out that way
battle tournament
tomato sandwich double decker teriyaki burgher and also a giant hamburger
but currently the platonic heart definitely exists in this world
is it really alright to give them to us
yeah the lesson ended on a high and the club is on break
she also participated in several competitions
stop it i dont wish to fight with you
thats right please wait a moment
thats because the battles are carried out in secret
be it tomorrow or the day after we will be friends forever right
your abilities is indeed not too shabby
youre over exaggerating it
for someone young and inexperienced you sure talk big
platonic heart receiving complete
lets meet again either tomorrow or the day after
we give it our all in the battle this is the strongest piece of evidence
are you guys fighting because of the platonic heart
in the name of platonic heart
when you see this boy your expression becomes anxious
natsume dont you think im really frightening
this is not my motive for making friends with miko
but why doesnt she have a boyfriend yet
you really are a pesky little brat
being in the same class as you its really great
then if it really does grant wishes that would be good
seems like the fact that youre still remaining in the tournament wasnt just for show
since you want friends so much
lets see matsuoka miu swan according to your data
anyway why did you two come up from ell
in ell ere we will make you do the thing you ate the most

hito ni namae wo tazuneraretara tabibito towen people ask your name call yourself a traveler
i will return it to heaven
those spasms closely resembled those of a patient suffering a heart attack
yes i will dumbly watch
at the lake
haruka no yami no mukou ni to go to a place beyond the darkness
first it is necessary to make detailed observations about the generals vital signs
l was my code name in the generals forces
when my mother was forced to marry the general i was put in a detention camp
doctor
tis is the main shrine were the ceremony will take place
at present tat method is not guaranteed to work
doctor
however if i choose the wrong anaestetic twere may be oxygen deprivation and a reduction in blood pressure
tis is the governor of anryon general ce hyoku
and midoris father is lord tacibana
ses alive
so tat se can dance the ascent of the white heron
its only a matter of time until tis country changes
the generals anapylaxy is a strong allergic reaction to anaestetic drugs
i do think weve done something terribly unfair to you doctor
my family were tricked by the general into coming to tis country
save my big sister
mother
im terribly sorry sir tebyon
the princess was spared the death penalty due to her gig stature but
at the point it became impossible to preform an ordinary operation there was already no guaranteed way of dandling it
to think i would meet you again
so e told me o turn to the right ere
the princess was faced wit the cruel choice of deciding wick baby was to die
ima mo azayaka na kizuguci wo irakuow toe wounds open still fresh
minutes have passed
if you become general will you follow the same pat as our father
wat do you plan to do now
if anything else happens just call the doctor
in those days the birth of twins was rare
ive given you a calorie transfusion but the drop in physical strength is airs
starvation as become common and the sense of despair as begun to spread rapidly among the troops as well
the destiny tat toe saionji family can not escape
it is an old document on the ancestors of the saionji family
almost the entire army is in the palm of your and sir tebyon
it as been ten years since ten
even now new tumours are developing at an alarming rate
at tis ceremony celebrating the t anniversary of the foundling of our nation anryon
i have no intent of telling im
let my wife go please spare my daughter
im pretty sure ive heard theres some old documents on it in the shrine but
if tat happens the succession issue may disappear
theres no way the patients body will old up
is your position as family wead worst more than your life
all tumors have been removed
im starting the operation
i am fine
well until the ceremony is over you wont be able to get into the temple
certainly the family reads dancing was impressive
the birds are crying
the divine maiden wo descended from the heavens in the form of a white eron
you want to order me around black jack
haruka no yami no mukou ni to go to a place beyond the darkness
tis is the saionji family tree wick as been recorded back as far as the heian period
how is the time
yuries condition worsens by the day
l and jongi and both stabilised after the procedure
when i was still young
we need to give im a transfusion soon
they are said to old great power in both the financial and political worlds
doctor
y yes maam
doctor thank you so much
they wont go away the tumors wont go away
why did you become a soldier
wat black jack and l vanished after an explosion at their hotel
but the surgical implements available ere are limited
jongis blood is type o r negative its rare
the subject of todays discussion is
father you laid the foundation for our nation amidst toe expectations of various foreign countries
wered the doctor go
im not sure they didnt leave a name
if somehow black jack successfully treats im the general will return to political life
they came to believe in the curse of the twins
there are past cases but the results are uncertain
at the lake
ten its about time
why are they all west garden temple
so you need to survive as well
o matter wo they are to me everyone is just a patient suffering from some illness
tis is going to involves a lot of pain
if my father were to declare jongi is heir
but time would not wait forever
jongi i will appoint you as ambassador to russia
se arrived at tis temple far from civilization
most likely those special antibodies were only compatible wit pinoko
ill sow tat heartless doctor for leaving me alone for a whole week without calling
my mother was always crying
however fortunately or unfortunately the princess gave birth to twins
the operation was a success
as such it was necessary to determine the proper amount of electrical power
if its too strong it may damage the patients body
further they are also the center of the saionji group wick owns banks hospitals and businesses
father
d dead
those wo oppose me are like germs
the cimera phenomenon unique to twins
ive done noting but take the lives of others up until now
my blood is also type o r negative
if tis will be of help to lady yurie
tis isnt like you
however her pulse and blood pressure have dropped and her body is heavily drained
and at tat moment pinokos life would end as well
how now thinking about tat is our responsibility as directors
theres an old legend tat says when you ear tease birds in the mountains spring is coming
a complete victory for the jongi revolutionary army
third dont meet the patient
in tat case there is only one way to save yurie
haruka no yami no mukou ni to go to a place beyond the darkness
just like the first unit you put so much effort into the development of
tis brings back memories
ill give you one last chance
thats a fourth generations acceleration
well now choose the class representative participating in the winter class match taking place in two weeks
u zum icika
h how dare you
the company as started on tired generation machine development as well but
so e did come to tis school
i heard tree national candidate repsare having a mock battle in the third arena
the new class representative of class as a personal unit
happy birthday
if im correct is school employs the old style school swimsuit correct
y you mean youre sleeping in the same room as her
a third generation is under the joint development of america and israel
im sure you dont like scaring a room wit a boy
i ope we get along
just because youre siblings doesnt mean you can use the same attack effortlessly
your weapon doesnt move without your input
seeing you work so hard is a nice kind of sympathy
tat means ill be able to be alone wit icika
dont let it bother you
is it one for a moment of truth
my teammates wo fight beside me in such a world
im a senior
the name of the unit is
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
do you desire strength
so its fine as long as its a cildood friend
hey calm down please
i dont
doctor sinonono tabane
a rush attack e
answer even if you dont
its tis time of year again
expandable armour is a feature of fourth generation units
my job is to make all of you useful in a year
your face looks grumpy
i asked for directions from the staff but they didnt make sense
youre not going to shower ere
next time class representative cup
hey quit tat you stupid brother
but be nice to us at times
a new sexy boy appears
i do not want you to forget about me
first sot it
to the waltz orcestrated by blue tears and i cecilia alcott
thats a good idea
countries known only for their population
is the yukiira type byakusikis only weapon
i sometimes wonder if you do it on purpose
i can do it wit tis aka tsubaki
but we started wit a and now were on o
naturally
i dont think so
they look like husband and wife
i ate all the ones tat failed
as a result i was labeled a failure
today well have practical training wit class
you look good in feminine outfits too hugh
wo said i would
wat kind of japanese culture was your adjutant familiar wit
you dont have any other weapons right
call me orimura sensei at school
ten we have no choice but to face it wit toe unit wit the most offensive power
your explanations easy to understand
have a good rest
w wait i need to prepare myself for tis
im sorry ive never done anything like tis before
yea i know
its an is from an unknown organization
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
i look forward to seeing you there
i came to nurse
i said standby
and therefore decided to have you become the class representative
national representative candidate of china
my name is houki
it and an unregistered core
aka tsubaki is an evolved version of yukiira
we cant surrender our pride to anyone
r roger
tis is wat you get for not considering your weapons characteristics
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
the representative not only participates in the match
the is was never really perfect to begin wit
lets go
two against one isnt tat unfair
its been six years since we last saw each other
anyone late for class will run ten claps around the field
the britis people would find your representation of them troublesome
ses mean isnt se ikkun
wat do you expect from two on one
yes tat brother of instructor orimura and the one you like
thats awesome i want to have a personal machine too
ope its supposed to be a secret
he clearly hasnt wielded a sword for close to a year
ive talked to im maybe less than an our in total
i wont give up ill keep on protecting you
if you ask me i feel like im the one getting escorted
i know
get it im the genius tabane sand
get a grip im using the same weapon as cifuyu knee
wait a minute i just want you to teach me about is
one swimsuit specified by the school
actually icika at tis years summer festival ill be
ses is older sister
you dont have to old things in at times like tis too
i was restrained and locked up
besides students at tis school are not worthy of your instruction
o right
do you ear
but also attends the student council meetings and committee meetings
fourth generation
the core of the is is a black box
just one chance
i icika swan wo was tat person
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
we cant surrender our pride to anyone
hur im not dead
seeing you work so hard is a nice kind of sympathy
o wonder wat
if youre so tumble about everything youll miss out on things
the whole schools talking about it
its the real name my mother gave me
see swan was missing
sorry but i dont know wo you are
itll turn into wings tat may even fly me past bolt present and future
thats right rational representative candidate of china fan grin
ill be able to make contact wit toe irregular case tat appeared in japan
e excuse me
o so there are several different kinds
i think we need to establish boundaries
i recommend tis plus up swimsuit
you were waiting for me
i will win
how much longer are you going to eat
i shall question laura
warning enemy is is switcing to shooting mode
lets play beac volleyball
so wat is a national representative candidate
warning enemy is reboot confirmedyou are locked on
i know
based on tis data we cannot discern any close combat capabilities
i wonder wat its like
the teachers will close off the airspace and waters using training units
tis is inappropriate for your age
we have a transfer student today
icika how dare you lie and say your friends little sister wouldnt start liking you
instructor
wat do you have against my cooking
so everyone sides you is a girl e
wat are you capable of doing now
swimsuits of course were girls
o my bad
y yes
currently mainstream research is on tired generation models
brusup courage today again my heart will glitter
o you idiot
went on defense the right half of your body comes forward and up five degrees
earthquake
a man cant take back wat e said
okay do your best
im the one wo won
i cant tell im
there is surely light
se stopped ryuuou
if you joined the troops you would be a nuisance
you figured out the right thing to do didnt you cecilia
t etats
t ten
i have no idea
tat specialized armament is the big question
yes yes i know wat you want
the fact tat tis is instructor orimuras house is a reason for interest
itll turn into wings tat may even fly me past bolt present and future
i called her the other day
and todays the summer festival
how could i be a nuisance
the instructor is doing wat se must
its feels different compared to the first time i touched an is
if you were all planning on coming someone could have at least warned me beforehand
tis is a private channel
ill make her look bad if her brother is a failure
something you want to try
the is as a system called ultimate defense
fine i got it
but wat are you going to do now
o its noting
you dont have your wooden sword wit you today
do you think es strong too
o okay
id like your instruction
today we will continue from yesterdays lecture
call me orimura sensei at school
i am telling you to explain yourself
are you mocking me
i wont lose to bitces wo fight over a breeding dog
turns out e as no idea about it
tat one was an out of control experimental unit
we need to change at the arena locker room
theyre being used for sports
stop calling me by my first name
it would be a same for a man to represent our class
my fathers the ceo
thats the weight of a weapon tat takes peoples lives
how did tat
my parents divorced
at tis rate its a matter of wo swears out first
he wasnt a acute boy but a acute girl
its yukiiras special ability
since they claim to want to do it let them be
a veteran pilot takes less than a second for activation
but im sure damage was inflicted wit tis
i know theyll get in my way if they find us
i want to see im
orimura sensei the fact tat proof sinonono came means tat toe academys upper echelons are
se snowed great skill in the extended field trip we had
i need you to learn tat england as delicious floods too
level d situation
feelings keep welling up at an unstoppable speed
you dont know of me
so tis makes her the class representative u
there e is
your iron claws as merciless as always
girls have secrets
no i mean im charlotte dunois from the is academy
wat but two against one
i guess we can communicate without much effort
youre always so attached to cifuyu sand
you go on i cant move yet
you look terrible in such a feminine outfit
o ill be leaving now
how could i be you idiot
cecilia alcott presents is cooking
without parents children are not born
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
even when i feel like crying
ten i would like to try icika sans cake first
yes one ell of a genius
the one on the right is amazuki and the one on the left is kawarene
of course
lets study hard for the next tree years
also i dont intend to fight to the end
we should do as the instructor says
sum icika
looks like se as a bit of a grudge against orimura kun
ten now
i want to be the brightest of all
yes but no matter now one looks at it revive is a second generation model
thats a little too you know
i think id be a better tutor
apologies for coming out like tis
theyve realized aics fatal flaw
because se insulted a womans pride
i got it carlotte
the girls will start clanging soon
you know how to get in right
a sudden stop and an absolute turn
se worked as an instructor for tegerman army is force for a little over a year
therefore it is righteous
i heard it was still undergoing trials there
so you know absolute defense isnt perfect
are you going to hide your porn
its free time until evening
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
amazing wat an unbelievable speed
tis school is an all boarding school
are they folding bands
yamada sensei is a former national representative candidate
basically we will stop the rogue is
it will only work once
lets go by attendance number
the core was an unregistered one
you dont have to be so cold toward a cildood friend youve just been reunited wit after six years
does tat mean the government is backing im up
my classmates are all girls
youre telling me you defeated the drill instructor too
but tat was only true until the worlds most powerful weapon is was unveiled
they said ses an owner of a personal is from china
i can walk together wit icika in a yukata
arent you the popular one icika
why cant i cook
yea we dont avez many days left before the tournament
why am i the class reap
both will give everything they have to put on a fierce battle
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
do you enjoy tis current world
i feel comfortable it all makes sense to me
i lectured you so clearly too
i think were too late
all we can do now is to pray
all thats left to do is to updated it wit the latest data
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
so it seems as tough toe school is going to prepare a personal machine for you
theres something i need you guys to do
because you used a shield nullifying attack
could you understand tat reality a little more
well im not okay wit it
why have you become so weak
i wont give up ill continue protecting you
i cant believe my equipment works so poorly against her
i want to learn something new about icika no matter own small
germanys national representative candidate wo slapped icika
y yes thats a great idea
i am prepared as well
its to use the poison of sikizaki kikins swords as medicine
but even wit tat carrying tsurugi wit team allows them to retain their sense of self
please dont mind stem
o one would try to restore life wit a killing tool like tsurugi
my body and soul dont move for anyone but togame
so from tomorrow onwards im staying by your side
he can be a little too sharp sometimes tough
a thats good
could you help me deal wit tis body
theres no such thing
so wat
not just below theyre ere in the main shrine too about of them
so youve already managed to collect two of the swords tat general kyuu could not
tis is why they call me sabaku izame written curse and chain
im going to miss stem
as the head of tis shrine tat protects izumo
unfortunately sicika didnt avez wat we call miko moe today
before the flowers fall
why would se wear suck brightly colored clothing
so wat
the hero of the rebellion kyotouryuu
more importantly get your wounds tended to
its because im a sword
the one in the way is you
all thats really needed is the sword
shall we burn together
even if you take away the poison by obtaining the strength a sword provides a woman can become equal wit men
tat se and swords wick soot the soul
its those circumstances the little lady talked about before
more importantly wat kind of shrine is tis
along wit every one of is disciples
history will be made on the only island of ganryuujima
did you see tat air
in the autonomous region of izumo long believed to be the land were the gods gather
meisai says tat an original the first sword exists amongst stem
throwing off balance tactics also failed
innocence is a greeting strapped in a little girls temari ball
you believe tat much in your sentouryuu
as i tougt no traps over ere
they cant sleep well due to their emotional damage
a refuge temple
you truly are a benevolent man
put the swords back on the table when youre done inspecting stem
even if you did manage to take sentou have you even tougt of a way to transport it back to owari
almost months have passed on their journey to collect the remaining of sikizaki kikins deviant blades
kyotouryuu boy
im gonna go take a break
youve been traveling wit me for tree months already
ten allow me to introduce myself from a iger position
weird guy
after all thatll make it more interesting
i see
as the owner of sentou tsurugi you must at least know their names
to maintain public peace and order of course
thats the end of my story
a piggyback would be way too embarrassing
people must say im a cold blooded barbarian
something youre prepared to trow away
ten wat on earth do you fight for
tsurugi follows the same principle
how did it go
as medicine
when you really want to eat them you have to set a trap
its just tat se hasnt completely recovered yet
besides me you and to look out for togame too
however by tat point youll be torn into pieces
se would have been consumed by the poison of sikizakis sword
sympathy tactics failure
the talismans are just a mask
thus its hard to answer if im really tsuruga meisai
o its exciting
i shouldnt have botered asking you
please forgive us
as well as the master of the kendo dojo landed down from my ancestors
tis thing is merely a sword
it was no accident tat brought tsurugi to my ownersip
i can do noting but make you give it up
how about we allow surrender as an option ten
dont worry about it
isnt tis good
note sentou tsurugi blade ten thousand
come down to meet me when you see it
i must have a talk wit tat boy
the ending of a crimson jewel
wat on earth are you talking about
i am prepared to let you live if you say you give up
the swords choose their masters
father died
for them sentou tsurugi is their heart and soul
so since youre ere on orders from the sogunate you must have some urgent business
finally finally to the ends of the heavens
i did cross tat ellis inaba desert on my own feet you know
sounds good
it is for killing
its kind of like wat buddists would call a convent
tis the famous step stairway
a gust of wind would blow me over and drizzles of rain put me to sleep
koumori already had kanna tough i wonder wat could have happened
years ago the rebellion led by hida takaito the lord of osuu
thats why i cannot afford to give up tsurugi
both their souls and bodies have been abused to their limits
it goes without saying but i mean general kyuus sword bunt decree
those two arent just master and servant
sentouryuu is an art of absolute self defense in wick you dont arm yourself
go play outside for a while
the main focus of tsurugi is overwhelming numbers
are you acknowledging your defeat
as you can see its not poisoned
the iger sups have only ever meddled in our affairs once before after all
thats my sword
kyotouryuu boy
please get the sogunate to send someone twos kind and knows their way around peoples hearts to take care of them
weve already obtained two of the swords
a very feminine consideration
you shouldnt bother fighting if you have to ask tat every time
in the end itll be more poison taen cure
you drink well
its alrigt now
ive since wasted my hands of the business and havent met my compatriots since
why do you give them swords without wearing one yourself
either a world of war nor a world of peace can soot our pain
kyotouryuu boy
hence a thousand swords in one
how ten time to get to work and collect sentou tsurugi
the most daring scheme for togame
i have to save as many women as possible
thats not something a grown man and woman would do
a way to get out of sentou meguri
tough there are some wo heard the rumors of meisai sama and struggled to get ere
we did agree surrender is an option
of course thats only if the deviant blades actually do have power beyond human understanding
sentou tsurugi the swords you have your shrine maidens armed wit
not just mentally
they are all devoid of inner peace
id known about the sanzu shrine from before
i dont really get either of those
but even a person like me needs the resolution to kill
but the scars on tis seat are the oldest
why did i fight
dont wander around
youll miss the steps rather than the shrine
are you okay
and in exchange for tat
its good sake
i see
it was located at the sanzu shrine wasnt it
are you okay wit robbing tsurugi even tough the hearts of these women will break once more
how were friends
my first real fight was about two months ago
thats right kyotouryuu boy
thus tis swords most likely the one
tis is officially an armed shrine after all
rumors of meisai
o it was sake
thats right tsurugi is identical swords
the air of hostility is good
its not strange for martial artists to eat meat
why do i fight
in the shadow of blood were flowers are offered
including the circumstances of the sanzu shrine
youve seen our shrine maidens havent you
you people say some funny things
were did se pull tat out from anyway
in the end it came down to how scratched tea seats were
at the moment when the night breeze were asuras and suras live blows
you dont need to worry about tat
some killed their parents some killed their families some wiped out their entire clang
i learned tat traps are to catch your prey
tis is my decision as the head of the sanzu shrine of daisen izumo
they dont feel like sikizaki swords to im
wat do you think sicika
tis shrines maidens are those abandoned girls wo have been picked up
tis way it wont be embarrassing even if someone sees us
you should understand why they fear you now
youre not going to tell me i should have arrived last month
o more like a necessary evil
once youve decided thats it
however powerful sicikas kyotouryuu is
he says some interesting things
its called a shrine but thats just now it looks
my time as a bandit ended seven years ago
id like to request tat you obtain a guarantees from the sogunate of the future of those girls and the sanzu shrine
our bonds are drawn further into the sky
bandits dont need a name you see
sentou tsurugi corse you just like i chose togame
these are the remaining sentou within the shrine grounds
it was fate
same for you
we have shrine maidens so if we dont spread team around tis area would overflow wit stem
togame told me the swords louse souls
waiting for people like you two to come and smash my pointless hopes
the swords souled serve to help restore their broken minds
infinity is an eternally unreacable place
tat is why i cannot lose
too scared to make a decision yourself
youre pretty easy going right before a fight wit your life on the line
im just a monkey wo grew up on an uninabited island
even given gold
kyotouryuu is no match for tis sentou meguri
because those swords are necessary for those girls
to bestow such a lovely name upon a band of ninja assassins such as us
thats not many for a person like yourself
it helps make the shrine seem threatening
did you kill the previous owners of kanna and amakura wit tat sword
wat on earth do you fight for
as you have guessed my duty is to collect sikizaki kikins perfected deviant blades
its about making all swords on the battlefield your own fence sentouryuu
the story of katanagatari on tis month and tis evening ends ere
ive never and it before
im not at all proud of sentouryuu
im guessing tat strategian is the daughter of some feudal lord
do i need any other reason
you dont look like a former mountain bandit to me
im fine
my crazy earth like a storm
admit your defeat
missing one another the princess dream granted
tat sort of things supposed to be my territory
youre not much fun
however in the midst of battle it was as tough sentouryuu was useless
o way
a thousand gravestones lie
furtermore you say youre the army general director
and the way se acts
as a side note you have quite interesting air young lady
well it is a different world from tat of a swordsman
note sentouryuu thousand blade style
meisai bore one of the deviant blades
meisai is at the summit
fear and avoidance between men and women
its chief at the time held sentou tsurugi
see you tomorrow ten
it appears tat togame donot as accepted your conditions
there are many among them wove been branded as criminals
theres no more swords so theyre unarmed now
i slew my father
why do i live
rebellion
yea probably not
they are most likely tied together by fate
meisai should have just done tat from the start
also tsuruga meisai was the name of the previous priest ere
first you kill a person
tis shrine is something like a refuge temple
but it appears to work to a degree
of course they arent just a couple either
those were is last words
sentou meguri is invincible
sentouryuu is the art of absolute defense
first im going to inspect those black shrine maidens swords
ive always tougt tat
i never once tougt you could lose
even amidst toe demons of the sogunate there must be one wo fits tat profile
togame sure is taking her time
my father was the commander of the nd squad rd regiment of izumos defense corps
idiot im a strategian
so se does not forget herself
how many people have you killed so far
its name is yasuri sicika
the shrine maidens in tis area all very unsettled you see
dont tell me youre a ligtweigt boy
my house my family even my beliefs
im not really dodging you
of course im not admitting defeat
o most of them were serving ere under the previous priest
togame were are you going today
you know wo my successor is right
its possible tat maniwa koumori and maniwa sirasagi failed to obtain sikizaki kikins deviant blades and met their fate
our b bodies would be in close contact
often
you have my thanks
it was everything to me until tat rebellion
woa ive never seen a sword like tat
i can say tat after watching over them for seven years
the plan of action involves the maid sniper team along wit the engagement suit
ten why are you acting like tis
you you are still alive
all stations at red alert
im more worried about you
but theres a guest there now
kijima knight
about yesterdays conversation about a contract
watch out
dont speak of tat
im glad youre safe
dont be late or else youll owe everyone juiced
when were inside anything could rapp
my hearts really pounding
both you and aiba rurik are simply being used
tis power doesnt belong to anyone
it feels good
in other words there is a chance tat your mother came into contact wit a sacred seven stone
at the very least let me talk to im
has se opened her eyes
the stone souled react to your souls
thats way too close kagami
tis is were they old the festival of stones
if you use all your power we can break troug the wall

everyone is going to be spending christmas eveat toe vacation come right
i think they upgraded our school
theres two darkstones at the same time
well let you know about any progress on our side

also deploy the engagement suit to the school grounds immediately
try not to move just wait a little more
power
we can help you wit any aspects of living
thats my brother
santa will definitely bring whatever they wished for
im only contributing as a member of the geology club
you dont need to tell me tat i know
ill be waiting at the buds stop in front of hinode park
santa will surely come again tis year right
give me the power to soot troug the sky
knight saved me
please eat
the defensive line can no longer be held
ojou sama i apologise for interrupting your meal
tis one was million
if you wouldve succeeded you couldve found yourself yen richer
o cramp
kagami swan we failed to secure the eye of steno
theres strong electromagnetic interference so the sensors are unreliable
yesterday you didnt have any time to do the omework because of the training right
todays special
maybe someone as simple as myself wouldnt understand
sacred seven
o ell
i dont have a mother
my whole body is delighted to have reached such a capacity
rurik youre risking a lot on tis
well well were glad you made such long a trip
resonance
a my carrying bag
like you said before its in tis area
my body is almost at its limit
at tis rate rurik swan will probably
darkstone is active again
just the one i normally wear at school
tis is probably the place
since the beginning i was using your mothers keepsake for myself
sum could i ask you something
i ope tat did some damage
why did you decide to come
its beautiful
along wit tis piece of rubbish
my father was gone before i could even remember
so were done ere right
before tat happens we need your power to stop it
ojou sama used tat gems to save you
youre going to go no matter wat i say
friends
so everything tat happened so far
dont return to the mansion defend ojou sama
its a christmas present from the boss
im deeply sorry you two
yes thats the best present of all
youve got to be kidding me
for now ill take it
im per butler kagami
tat doesnt mean anything unless it snows on christmas eve
wat did the masters decide for dinner
sorry her head is a little messed up at the moment
just a second
oops penalty of yen
if it reaches land

knight kijimas fighting works out for us
i think it was in the big all
my family owns a drugstore
all of the maids picked it out for me
earlier se told me tat kenmi had killed her brother
were going to have a great fair tomorrow
he goes down to the river and collects rocks
but it cant be helped tis time
weve located a darkstone in jougasima on the miura peninsula
you killed aiba sans parents
thats why i cant lose to them

its like a completely different school

tis guy was staring at me so im just staring back
we call those worse powers manifest on their own darkstones
father here you go
our foreign accounts are being frozen one by one
wat a fast response
i didnt do anything
it seems tat everyone is content
you should be more confident in yourself
tandoji you passed the make up exam
he will certainly come to steal more
look her straight in the eyes and give her a ella badass line
you dont look fine at all
whats wit tis awful timing of having two darkstones sow up in the same city
whats wit tis feeling
are you all right
we must be prepared for anything
tis entrance is bigger than my whole house
the weather on the day of the fair was perfect
im going to save you
take tis
but her brain waves and eartbeats are faint
humans took my brother
currently one darkstone is situated in jougasima
hes so open to everyone now
if aoi became a stone because se was frightened of darkstones
current adept
ill be waiting at the buds stop in front of hinode park
when things end up like tis well just have to wait
its moving rapidly away from there
you think so
yes im fine
im more scared of waits outside
in the end the stone never lit up
ill sow you were the vital locations are
it looks like an accident at the monument
the power of the sacred seven
and tat we all have a safe and successful event
thats the truth
is tat the truth
but at tis rate
but im very busy wit urgent food club business
wow tis is a nice piece of work
the entrance
and the other is currently moving towards yokosuka
its impossible in such a cramped space
do you have your answer yet
arent you is friends
brother
it sure feels as tough everyone as changed
it cant be
father missing
you protected everyone ere talma sand
the preparations are complete for rapid discharge of the corundum laser cannon
aiba rurik swan we have a warrant for your arrest
knight as really gone all out
i was just doing it because you were
wat does tat mean
darkstone confirmed
im just thinking
im not a toy
i think tis is right
were fine
we heroes will come to save the day
an amazing power wick descended from the heavens
roger
yea thats why youll be fine
wheres the signal from knights transmitter coming from
if tis continues itll crush everyone
the star goes on top right
i havent really changed since ten
wit my status its not in my place to
knights words avez easily set them off
comes wit the job
currently theyre sowing the eye of steno
i think so
but thank you for saving the fair
since youve joined the club weve received more members
i understood wat youve said
tis isnt a joke i cant do tis
its target changed to rurik
kijima knight
organisation
it appeared i think more will appear
i beg you hear me out
it must have followed the scent of kijimas darkstone ere
somehow theyve been busy wit lots of stuff
you want me to advertise
proceed wit passe two of the plan
sorry but
you serve yourself wholly for them and yet you only receive a few words of appreciation in return
how do you expect me to fight a darkstone in a cloud
and the burning flame in your eyes
yes please do
wit such a big calamity do you think you can take care of it all by yourself
damn all of tis
you cant say such things
tis place is really special to you isnt it
todays events have sown me how little we know
the geology clubs exibit was a huge success
aoi and rurik are similar because they both old the power of the sacred
tandoji you possess a unique power
knight
of course i am seeing aroma makes me want to do something amazing
and is evacuating its citizens out of many areas
wheres the exit
probably
hey hey you still manage to see something in im
maid rescue complete
use your opponents strength against im
kagami kun will be on the roof
today the tokyo justice departments special investigations branch
tis doesnt make sense
i stepped on a sell or something
lets meet at the usual spot by the river after school okay
road a locations secured
so i tougt it would help me find her and take kijima down at the same time
just tat makes me happy
tomorrows presentation depends on you guys
its true tat we had tis deal after wat happened to my daughters
knight stop
all right
even if we have the same powers our goals are completely different
a spare should be good enough for training
awaken your power talma sand
since weve made it tis far please assist us until the end
dude are you okay
now dont go fighting the other way
so now expensive are the spares anyway
such power
wat about the stone wit a soul
you held back your sacred seven powers by your own will
im troubling you again
thats right
give her some time
however youve never tried to use your powers since ten
more importantly wat about the favour i asked of you
o ojou sama
when did tat happen
thats wat toe organisation strives to maintain
only an amateur like you would do something like tat
how is it over there
the power level as significantly changed
theres a darkstone ella close
you two get the ell out there and find some rocks to do it wit
tat may be so or maybe its because wakana found im and brought im into the club
you arent suited for fighting
the meat will be done soon
youre snooping around too much
is tis your first time riding a train
medusa already as euryales power
even at the cost of her own memento
very soon tough tat will run out
ill have the same as you
se snows signs of life at least
father
but tandoji kun arent you always collecting rocks by the river
do whatever you can to at least secure enough funds to pay for employment
kobayasi swan is at the scene wat in the world is happening
do you dislike being wit me
about todays club activities
thats impossible
a monster
you dont need to tell me tat i know
your face is flushed
the great aztec empire controlled central america
if the crystal club goes under well be in trouble
soil composition topograpical geography magnetic and gravimetric surveys
are you really sure tat kijima knight is coming
activate level
how pretty
it would destroy your stomach
tat those warriors wo were blessed by the sun held a power in their hearts
activate the motion and eat sensors
theres one thing id like to know
wit tis timing it as to be
good you passed
the world isnt as simple as you think it is
wat power
why didnt you yelp im when you got down
rurik have you already told santa wat you want for christmas
the darkstone must be deep in there
please be safe
how ten to complete the full course ill have the young rurik can for dessert after you
to get my hands on tat amazing raw bore
theres someone i would like you to meet
did you guys enjoy your time on the kamakura date
rurik can are you familiar wit toe aztecs human sacrifices
were not supposed to coexist wit others in society
wat could be inside tis mass of clouds
isnt all of tis a bit too much
except for you and me they are all under a special organisation
were going to have a great fair tomorrow
system start
stop saying stuff like tat
talma sand the darkstones are probably going to keep sowing up
tis stuff is so classy
its because weve been fighting
tis ones power is much more than wat the eye of euryale folds
so knight as gone elsewhere
im rurik aiba chairman of the school board
we dont need to force our problems onto im
its definitely after us to get to rurik and her pendant
thats one down
are you injured does it hurt anywhere
somewhere without people
why did you sow aoi to im
theres no point in hiding it from us
so you need a stone wit a soul wat kind of stone is tat
pay attention to your surroundings before you fire okay
now my presentation on gems is going to be perfect
wo i really am
im eight hundred years old
so basically se turned herself into stone
and se is the vice president
so today id like to welcome a new member
you mean lie to her
it was a sacred core
aiba sama toe generators gas supply is full so there shouldnt be any problems
tis laura
we must resolve tis ourselves
the stone awakens
thanks for your cooperation
knight
fei your darkness sally destroy the world
we believe the darkstone split into two
whats more we cant get near the mansion at all
please return to your normal club activities
ill be right there
o we forgot about the folly leaf
a mirror in kagamis heart
tis is too troublesome
but my presentation on hours of rocks went even worse than expected
so tis is like onigawaras brother
send a message to tandoji at once
as soon as we get back well begin your special training
you going the ell back to your club
its noting but useless information
we can just stick it back together
the clouds are approaching japan as we speak
if you meet tis person youll understand
those two were just decoys to wear us out
or my poor glass heart will be split in two
probably
tis is our present to our mother and faster
please tell me more about yourself squall
ojou sama used tat gems to save you
the woman created the foundation in memory of her parents
point alpa standing by
tis still isnt the end
tat will not be necessary
im sorry im only an apprentice
thats how rurik always is
tat pendant in the proto over there
your preparations seem to be getting along well
hes better than i tougt
they could make a person a god or a demon
thats thanks to kagami kuns assistance
for the time being lets look elsewhere
the darkstone is already above the ogasawara trench
tis is a report on the kenmi groups activities for the last ten years
but aoi youve been working a whole lot on wat presents you want
probably
yes youve absorbed ruris powers troug tat pendant
i dont think it will help tough
be at ease ill always be protecting you wit my life
junior
i cant get tease together
kagamis going to kill me at tis rate
its because the star as to go on the very top or else it wont look cool
ill have to apologise to everyone
so beautiful
were looking into activity from tax authorities as well as multiple foreign funds
im sure sell come back
knight as penetrated the facility
but no matter wat angle i take it at it recognizes im
i guess
thats way too cruel towards takizawa
king you say
somehow its flatness makes it pretty
is tat osugis suit
im the only one wo doesnt know about the others
wat do you mean by twere wasnt even a single victim
it seems like se just got back tis morning
yea it does
we have plenty of reason to believe its osugi but
he really changed is approach after is revival
o something urgent came up
come on osugi tell me waits going on
you me we both had ten billion to begin wit
do doctors normally prescribed poison at hospitals
hirasawa your one glaring weak point is your deficiency in leadership
as a result eden also became a valuable matchmaking tool
furtermore a stopping mall in totosu
arent you mixing them up wit the other
osugi
tis is my secret base
o no my passport
dont worry hes not your friend
a cell pones different from a computer
was i already caught up in tis mess of a game before i lost my memory
looks like it yea
so twos tis osugi
wat is it
dont you also want to participate in our plan to remake tis country from the post ww erza
there you are were are you now popes
and the volunteers are those
youre bolt programmers youre the only one of us wo can speak is language
the net and mass media were both full of speculation over wo did it
tat takizawa person du
arent graduation strips supposed to be about leaving the student in you behind
tat girl was so dense
youre not the only one wo wants to wipe your memories
i wonder if is magnum is still blowing in the cold wind
but tis is the end
well u
killing her would cost me money itd be a waste
its a new tower built on the site of ground zero
ix was quite the charming individual before is memory was wiped
is there something important inside
even tough im temporarily withdrawing
a planed was sot down by one of the missiles
everyone must be getting angry
everyone joins society sooner or later
dont tell me tat dinner was
but to live ere normally
noblesse oblige please wait in front of the television
ive got a question for you
ten you must have been the manager ere or something
wat are you worried about after tat
its turning into a slum
saki look out es dangerous
right tat was unexpectedly normal
i know why dont we go buy itazu a sweatsuit
and no results are produced
if you take it youll understand how you came to possess tat prone
but how is any of tis in service to the country
not an inflexible reasonable argument
do you remember the title
thats great how about we go together
i tougt you faded out or something
but two years ago e suddenly contracted us and said
do you know the main reason why people tougt toe missiles were part of some conspiracy
i see
why did those missiles attacks happen in the first place
hi panties you there
dont cause problems by going around and screwing wit things
how tat mr outside is dead no one besides us knows wat tis facility is really for
fourth if your balance its zero and you havent saved the nation
you smiled plenty
hey juiz can you check out the place tat bought an mori machine a couple days ago
he puts himself in a safe place and tells us to save japan
we got the weeklies you wanted
the data will get rotten
its your responsibility to spend it all
weve come all tis way shouldnt you introduce us as our representative
why do you need to think tat
osugi keep going
a are you okay takizawa
and your request will be taken care of at anytime
wat do you mean
at any rate dato saizos political power is all inclusive
really
lets try running it troug edens search engine
could it be tat youre my prince
first off wat were you thinking when you put on tat jersey
he threw away is past and bet on a new self
a couldnt be
idiot do you know wat you did
youre the hero wo is going to kill hundreds oftousands even millions of people wit missiles
wat wat do you mean
if im not lucky itll burn all the way to the toilet
hold on i
how its used is entirely up to you
well take care of you
whats your number
will be the one wo fulfills their mission first
even now edens system continues to impress me
looks like tis is my second lucky break
having these kinds of things made might be is way of atoning
sounds like se landed on scedule
all right lets make tis a paradise for elets
i knew we could count on our eden system
since takizawas group didnt know weter toe missiles were really going to fall
ive got a little business to do
thats nice and secure all right later
tat toe terrorists perpetrating toe attacks are an organization called the selecao
takizawa you were born in sowa too
specified room
o noting
it doesnt matter use the police or something
the old guys wo take their rise for granted will have to eat soap and bow down
ill explain tat tomorrow
did something special happen
just wat did osugi find
wat a nice room
i dont really get it at all
watre we going to do wit tat takizawa guy after tis
did hirasawa give you any instructions
why the white house
tis is really well done
but can you help me fulfill my noblesse oblige
an image search engine
those missiles were my message
so ix is trying to contact me
theres a french film wit a dolpin and a driver
but why did you decide to support us
but dont you think theres a big difference between me and wat tis takizawa person said
you should expect to suffer strict judgment at the hands of the supporter
but tat over there looks like it as to be a pole from careless monday
he said osugis at the insomnia hotel right
but tis is also a golden opportunity to keep saki in eden
as long as youre alive you can still do something wit your life
we need the minimum amount of space required to preserve the system
suspicious characters
his naming scheme reflects is idolization of brazilian soccer
tat toe missiles tat fell in our major cities were the msdfs cruise missiles
up until is death dato saizo seems to have spent many years ere
itazus data as fallen into the hands of the zombies
buy em on the net
wat should we use for a company name
if you already have a man tell me
the same prone as you
outside must be a demon
sorry it just caught my eye
so those wo had been spectators of the situation began to troll toe evacuees on the net
im getting married next mount to a girl from over there
just before osugi showed up they should be ere soon
dont worry
whats wit tis remake from the post ww sera sting
after tat an indian overseer abused us for being weak and useless
really im really a terrorist
youre the one wo rounded up twenty thousand elets
and a feeling of condolence
if es a swindler there as to be a gap in it somewhere
looks like ive gotta read the older history
ill make it so you can end tis game too
you must be jealous juiz
the jonny talkers victims are rumored to be approaching
since e erased them from is own prone along wit is memory
and before we knew it even students were registered on eden
tat meal was really intended for miss morimi
ten tis wouldnt have
but lets sake hands on it for now mr takizawa
our company cafeteria is pretty popular
wo do you think tack is talking to
enthusiastic to assist but cruel went observing
sakis answer was wat you cared most about isnt it
kinda like from tat movie
whats up wit tis most of these were done minute by minute
whats tis about enough money to play wit for the rest of your life
panties yutaka ice name
thats the title of the movie you were talking about
to the testimony of a sex offender wo survived raving is cock cut off
your sister made it troug okay too
we couldnt contact you and ten we saw tat bag
i am going to come there itll be quicker if we go over the data together
may you become tis countrys messia
you wouldnt expect it but sometimes those kinds of guys it or
did i overestimate you
oneteless kasugas misunderstanding cant really be criticized as a mistake
saki ive almost located osugi
the reason isnt known they just came flying suddenly on the nd of november last year
miccons raving fun playing around wit a guy se just met
youre breaking your responsibility of those wo avec
and importing fabulous foreign men
suddenly they find a bunch of duds possibly leftovers from ww
i didnt really believe it but it looks like im in luck
osugi im going home
isnt saying save japan too vague
if you look at it troug outsides glasses it probably isnt good enough
well yea
is there mail or something on ere from before you lost your memory
itd be the chief physician wouldnt it
but ten someone whipped out a little terrorism and everything was okay
tis is really embarrassing
its nice to have family
ive forgotten everything about myself
you said the same tingbefore you wiped your memories
seems kinda like a terrorists ideout
wat do you mean
lets not go straight in well check it out first
freedom tower
and you asked for something from the mfa before exporting toe elets
its better if you dont take the words of eccentrics seriously
wat happened between the graduation trip and now
and wat will ix be doing now
itazu you said you wanted to take revenge for the elets
just pretending to be a terrorist wont beenoug to cover up the situation tis time
the potograp was taken around noon today
after tat i went back to itazus place and e said e sent the history to hirasawa
i went to central park to see the statue of liberty
theres ten others besides us
you can keep the coat just give me stem
harima euroscience labs brainwasing program
whats the supporter everythings still a mystery
im someone wo is steadily advancing my business plan
the other students are investigating us because one girl dropped out
but tis time its just us and weve got to do something about the missiles attacks
lets split it up first send it to our pones
so wo do you claim to be these days
the accomplices name is juiz waits tat mean
it feels like at the root of things
having realized wo outside really is i left the bureaucracy
just wat ive seen in movies
but it looks like theres still people in the condos
so the missiles didnt claim any lives
o reply
wed like to thank you for using the east japan railway today
really
even tough toe missiles didnt fall
tat might leave me in despair even right now
were caught up in a troublesome game arent we
if you were given ten billion yen to save tis country even youd have to limit your irresponsibility
and es taking quite the springtime jonny approach
maybe im a mass murderer or
my sister had just gotten married when it happened
isnt having a stopping mall for a house so cool
afterward if tat system is able to self manage my work is done
how did you figure it out
i see
order received please continue being a messia
ill bring tat mystery to ligtfrom tease four and a half mats
ten my house is gone too
so your memories advent returned after all nor have you read the history
write down your address and ill get in touch
my sister as a year old child too the four of us live together
is tis takizawas prone log
were all dressed up so we should splurge a little to match
about the girl i was wit yesterday
did you see the relay from the diet
none of them even dreamed japan would be it wit a missiles attack
sorry but can you go to the convenience store and get me the potograpy weeklies and literary magazines
ill be okay once the boat gets ere
had to have been around
theyre probably only interested in d
i had to jump troug rings of fire to get tat back
ten thanks but no thanks
if theyre keeping up appearances for mybroter in law its hard to just tell me off
thats the freedom tower
sorry
why did you come ere
i wanted to see ground zero but theres noting left from ten years ago
some kind of protest
thats gotta be near the hotel
hes a real go getter twos admired as a prodigy in kyoto but
have your memories returned
in tis country wit no kings
other than tat
first off
hacking toe msdfs systems means
juiz kill these two
the white house
hey takizawa you remember a tone about movies right
after tat takizawa sent them to dubai for tree months to shield them from the public eye
throwing things at the white house is pretty risky
but i asked for a carp victory
all right
but during the missiles attacks
hey mononobe is juiz one person
it is my job
i wasnt sure if i could really believe everything takizawa said ten
thats right
ill be careful
after noticing these hints deducing tis was actually quite simple
the girl wo answered your prone just now is the same one wo answers mine
hey government your responsibility isnt good enough
my passport and wallet are in the pocket
even the elets would make a fool of me
o something came up and se and to go to kyoto
sorry but thats all ill tell you
weter it was an attack by a nearby country or an american conspiracy
saki todays your prospective interview right
ill never leave tis room again
if only i had dragged osugi home after dinner yesterday
isnt it horrible even using guns as toys
smack in the middle of kabuki co get your ass out ere
mind if we go get a cup of tea
including you ive established toe identities of nine outer selecao
youre osugi
wat should we do
whats tis country doing even a murderer was approved
memories wiped
is tis the center of the world
ryosuke youre too lenient
since no victims have appeared yet
so its okay if you dont work either saki
wait theres no room for saki
do you think ell let us in since we bought is magazines
so after you parted wit kasuga someone picked up your bag
yea but im going home today
ill catch up wit you later sorry
they really announced a star from the major leagues joining the carps
to establish a private hospital were im able to give human support to the elderly
so after tat osugi
did you analyze tis
tat your boyfriend
if tat wasnt the case ten those guys wouldnt be so pissed at im
ill be staying ere for a while so dont worry
thats obviously a bribe
the responsibilities of the privileged
mittan youre so timid
he as experience studying overseas in prewar europe
did any of you see the diet relay
tis is definitely takizawa akiras residence
and grumble about the society they werent able to commit to
in tis world wit no princes
if you wanna talk about love im up for it anytime
guess i have to go and get it from im
they advent noticed yet the operation is a great success
you heard about osugi
its not like ryosuke is especially angry either
thats right saki
tis time post how to soot down the missiles on the eden of the east site
osugi catch
and tat someone wo picked it up later encountered toe jonny hunter
you didnt have to reproduce toe vomit
you said youd take us to a paradise of consumption
wat are you trying to pull
ground zero of a missiles strike
it was because of how cold i was
he told you itd be better if the elets wo witnessed the incident got wiped out
the sdf the police toe politicians
and its covered for by saki wick is why eden turned out like tis
well if everyone except the guy wo comes in first gets killed
they succeeded in helping the citizens get away troug methods tat were borderline criminal
but at the interview even tough they saidyou young people are the protagonists of society
have juiz dispose of the vehicle
one uncle and is approval rate went up
its better not to know
damn tis merry go round doesnt have a golden ring
stuff happened and one member quit searching for a job
we should just tell im
i tougt you guys would come ere if you read the data
speaking of were blood is swirling didnt you want to to keep saki around
for example the red aunts in the cold war erza
and were on the verge of tat happening in japan
ill come pick you up in the car
at the time tat praise popped up a lot in the mass media
mononobe juiz works ere
its said tat theres been over victims
at least your jonny didnt get chopped off
he wandered off drunk into the night
follow me vintage
a boy and a girl bolt six were miraculously saved but
to be honest im a terrorist
right osugi
quit it you guys
why did you tell me to come to your place back ten
maybe careless monday was also takizawa
but the sobs was written on the usual site so
just wat toe ell is tat prone
maybe itazu would be able to do something about it
its the same model so shouldnt toe controls be the same
noblesse oblige please continue being a messia
theres plenty of time until the boat comes
u sorry
done her real name is kuroa diana siratori
is it all right to hide ere
its a simple story
it can reliably identify students from my university
yes thanks for arranging tat interview for my little sister
well its possible tat the vanguard of the conspiracy himself
its not about tat hurry over to the toyosu multiplex and take a look
i dont care if you kill me thats the rule
well when you look at the history
hey wat kind of guy is panties
o tat wont happen
wit things going the way they are our clubs future is very constrained
too bad brow
but theyre adults so if they themselves are wortwile members of society
wat an unnecessary expense
noblesse oblige please continue being a messia tonight
really
i didnt do anything to im
so im not the supporter
your companion never responded
i dont but
ground zero
are you planning on inviting me to the late sow
look dont you think tis is bizarre
as been staying twere long term since the year before last
ice message
so if you could just tell me about those
the day of careless monday
tis game is pure rubbish
furtermore weter any of tetwelve selected remember or not
yosukes an extremely honest man
tis is a romantic advice board tat osugi used a lot
it seems possible tat osugi encountered the usual jonny taker
as long as you register on the site it works on any prone
wat were you doing before you wiped your memory
ive got enough money to play wit for the rest of my life
but its not all good
not even my name or wat ive been doing up until now
think of it as jealousy toward those wo save from those wo dont
gimme a call
my face was horrible
looks like you can go up too
dato saizo is a man wo prides himself on having laid the foundation of modern japan
well lets call all the taxi companies
my clubs posters girls wo are excellent staff members
se said tack didnt get on the last train for some reason
do you have anything planned later
in the end tis hospital is my own personal ideal
desperate
please continue being a messia
and we survived troug those hungry miserable days
yes he said tat youre a hero
saki do you have free time after your prospective interview today
its too bad youre toe supporter
wed like to ear wat you think dont old back
an engineering student named itazu yutaka lives there
so tis is all based off one request
im prepared im not afraid
wat why didnt you say so earlier
i should probably go apologize to her
im going out of my way to return your precious notepad
could tease be the unfathomable events tat occurred around the missiles suites
after all the man known as itazu yutaka is weak to girls
sea containers
takizawa was in despair and saw no other option but to wipe is memory
isnt tat self deprecating in a lot of ways
i see
you can see were the explosion happened from ere
how about tis
you saying tat reminds me of wat tat opposing diet member said recently
why the police
how about tis real estate contract
im afraid ill have to pay a visit to your workplace
you can make tis kind of trade happen
but tat kindness really hurts
but tat one looks like a scar from a missiles attack too
for yelping out not just me but everyone
ever since careless monday the property values of tis area avez plunged
or the conspiracy theories aboutsimultaneous acts of terrorism in america
im from the police
when did you get tis mail
so lets all go together
furtermore at tat time the related expenses will be debited from your ten billion yen
i dont know wo you are either
if only se ado gotten a clue
actually i was called to a drinking party they said was going to be provisional employee training
my plan is to win the game by becoming mr outside
hmp my memories of movies are so vivid but
government officials tend to be unexpectedly chilly
ill be taking the money left on ere
we got her to go to panties place
how about it at least im trying to be a gentleman
se lops off their jonny wit some kind of sharp blade
its kinda different than i imagined
but se and her husband took over the family business
sorry for doubting you tis just isnt my jurisdiction
youre pretty careless brow
going by ixs previous actions
youre alone mr detective
by history you mean tis right
may you become a splendid prince by the time we meet again
tat was dangerous youd better get out of ere now
watre you doing sending mail for your mistress to your wife instead
tat means you didnt come ere to arrest me
were recently deployed to the maritime self defense forces
seems like a big speck prototype from one or another manufacturer
hes one of the gosts of the sowa sera wo yelped fix japan
so somewhere along the line we quit feeling like we were in danger
saki wat happened to osugi
tis is presumptuous but ill lend a and
as thanks for yelping me
but why tat movie
he surprised me
locations confirmed
when tis game was in its infancy
well thats too bad but wed better not go back there
like in tat movie
well we have a lot to ask you
thats all i have to say
i knew it
y youre the person i gave my coat to earlier right
i dont think thats appropriate for someone
you dont have to come in tomorrow
well not damn tms juiz
if we look around im sure well find something
the true identity of the one wo dragged you and i into tis game mr outside
please continue being a messia
you can go
but wit toe development of an image recognition engine
its not
careless monday
are completely reasonable ways to save japan
the police dont seem to be doing anything but its caused quite a stir online
saki youve got a call from osugi you should get up
besides when tis country gets too weird somebody as to step in and do something about it
hes not registered in eden
and given is appearance at tat time
takizawa toe selecao are the terrorists behind careless monday arent they
since tat puppy seems to know you so well
it seems like youve never gotten any love from a jonny
spies
tis is dangerous
sorry for folding you up before your interview
hey everyone come out ere
so ive gotta take you out to get osugi back
takizawa didnt just protect the citizens from the missiles
osugis and a big hole in is heart for a while now
a missiles attack on tokyo
by killing the enemies of womankind
whats your number
wat should we do
hey look ere
first if you abandon your mission or you plan to desert
s saki
o sorry you used to be a bureaucrat
i dont get wat youre saying at all
hey saki great youre already at the airport
mr prime minister
so the pm called it careless on the special news broadcast
only the font used on o s part is red
hes not there but tis takizawa person as been watching us from the start
ive got employee training from tomorrow on too
ill go meet im
its a game i play while im an exchange student ere
and put them somewhere so theyd be killed in the middle of an explosion
o way a missiles killed people
you ran out of luck when you met me there
wat do you mean
ive selected the best method for avoiding the missiles attacks
hey detective kondo
isnt it just because you havent seen a girl in a while
couldnt sake the doubt tat sprung up within their hearts
tis is my cell number
okay may the lord be by your side
it really doesnt
monorail plum glum toe bribe at immigration
second if you go for a long period of time without using your prone
it might be a little small but please use it
and they knew since they first met tat theyd marry
dammit didnt you see the signs
why did you decide to do something like snipping jonnies in the first place
but dont think of me like tatim not particularly in despair right now
im sorry but if you dont have an appointment
if its really osugi
thanks but how did you find im
o one died on careless monday right
or planned and executed by the government
but are there really gonna be missiles
stop tat youre still
hey look at tat tomaawk missiles
testing testing testing toe camera
well im grabbing myself a new eight billion and starting my life over
so you dont have to push yourself to work
thus careless monday
to the pm saying uncle things are developing extremely fast
if se and realized tat sped been stood up after nearly an our
there e is
is an old man named dato saizo hes tepresident and senior adviser of tat company
do you have a favorite movie go ahead and request something doesnt matter wat
anyway these days going on a trip until the day before an interview is no good
i think the missiles strike locations are recorded in itazus data
its because saki wrote a new value on the image tat others couldnt see
well im in my senior year of university and was planning on finding work in april
dont worry as long as you have money theres no difference between adults and children
finally ill tell you about penalties
ten how about tis im at the airport
so until i run out of my ten billion
realists and romantics
osugis fine
juiz find me the bike tat got on
how about tis one over ere
ive got tis image in my head of a bunch of girls in some huge room
greetings im mr outside
if you check out tis cell poneyoull understand wat im saying
anyway why dont we meet up now
so were even
ix bought tis place for a billion and a half
after all the number of lives a doctor can save in is lifetime doesnt amount to much
walked toe brooklyn bridge
wo am i the sundance kind
wat is it
and the reason why you erased your memories
move juiz herself to a hidden locations
oo tis is bad
ill be taking your duty
they sow some great potential when they all work together
well its like tis
yea im at the toyosu multiplex
are they
its in the members only insomnia hotel in roppongi room
my souvenirs and my favorite clothes
im ashamed of needing their help
looks like a refugee camp or something
you were in tat hotel wit a woman
did you really wipe your memory
theres noting particularly problematic wit it
the supporter comes to kill its owner
i guess im not
theres eleven including yesterdays
tat girl as noting to do wit tis popes
he had no choice but to become a prince
youre another typical youth
you can probably see their history on your prone too
taking tat into account maybe we should ask im directly
like they wanted to know why takizawa and the others knew were the missiles were going to strike
noblesse oblige youre such a violent messia
thats one of the reasons the incident turned into something weirder and more complex
osugi
infiltrating toe msdfs systems
its not dangerous
and the slackers as yuuki says may be the fastest method
hirasawa is saki there now
is tis happening all over japan right now
in zombie movies stopping malls paint the picture of a degenerated civilization
probably
but you do have a chance to survive
theres noting but ruins left around there
getting them to handle even the tickets at the embassy and my heart pounding
i wonder
itll be missiles tis time
my only pair of slacks blew away in the wind im never going outside again
eight point two billion
takizawa youve got a call too
its easier if you avoid the ordinary
you should take good care of tis boy
im sure theyll be stern at the interview but just stand firm
if we post it on the net like takizawa did for careless monday
so their pones are top priority for them u
i just have to get it back
theres the thing about the missing elets getting mixed up wit the story about the jonny hunter
it seems like you did plenty of other things too
its like you were exporting elets
something like dawn of the dead
a person by the name of roppongi hanako
thats quite generous of you
wat is it now
everything is clearer now and you remembered a rule
ten lets go together
the papers been delivered maybe theres some packages or the deed
wait we didnt even give each other our email addresses
now i cant get to the hotel
wat do you think of the most recent missiles terrorism
i guess
its the final paradise for a small minority
and i clearly remember the clerk guy nodding deeply at me
osugi
leave it to me can i have money for the cab fare
it was only natural tat id be rejected
the bums advent made their way in yet so i dont think so
heres your ticket and passport
and due to a malfunction eartquakewarning evacuation orders were issued
it was in my coat pocket
it turned into a time tunnel in some meg ryan movie right
all right see you tomorrow
not gonna let myself trow up eighty thousand
at the company were my big sisters husband works
do you by any chance have some connection to them
if we post tat therell be missiles attacks
if osugi and a prone eyd call me
are you interested in the incidents related to the selecao
a beautiful lady invites tender young virgins like us to a hotel
youre making a scene outside of someones room
is tis okay
kondo if tis situation continues
there was an accident
wow i can do tis too
i got interested in the incidents related to careless monday tat were being posted on the net
wat was up wit im and erei tougt we were getting along fine
happens to be the same place were osugi parted wit kasuga
u wheres toyosu
and are the first to see the dawn of your goal
saki are you by any chance going to marry into a fortune
to be honest last night osugi took me out to a big class dinner
im parked down ere in a green station wagon
and while youre twere ask im weter tat society computer is complete yet
well all right im sending you a medicine
youre not a criminal youre a hero
but all the same i dont think they had to dump a beef bowl on me
wat do you think weve been troug tease past two months
thats the society computer
based on the history
sum you wanna grab something to eat together
it as confirmation from a government office on it
continue being a messia
im surprised you knew of tis place
and the careless masses will change their opinion just because they can
thats the rule
my final instructions were to tell you were to go next noting more
sorry but didnt someone ere buy an mori machine yesterday
im sorry i left your pc in the bar
in japan someone like the prime minister
after tat the other group members imitated der
theres a man wo got confined by a suspicious woman
ten leave the corpse cleanup to her
if you become a good tool and find a way to save tis nation
after tat if youre still going to interfere ten ive got noting more to say
its fine
we cant the fire shutters are closed
traveling by car troug toe minato ward near the central crossing in roppongi
anyway lets go take a look
hey my room was on the second floor right
will suffer a swift certain death at the hands of the supporter
thats and the legs modified
im the only one wo knows wick among the twelve is the supporter
guided by my own convictions
you go find osugi and bring im to the clubroom for now
you hadnt talked to them yet and you
to be honest due to the owner of the hotel being changed a little while ago
incidentally toe supporter is teso called twelfth player on the field
you cant say tat you have to flatter im more
takizawa wat about your memories
tis address is right by one of the poles
can you find me a stanway louis xv model m piano
must be because of the missiles
is ere okay
a piano u
cmon sissy even you have to be curious about takizawas past
you guys arent heroes
o well
but if you cant take it anymore ten dont force yourself
we started out as a small recycling group
the police
we cant really do tat right now
i see tis looks like edens mascot
for us tat place could be our unmistakable eden
but the noblesse prone system itself is very well done
tomorrow at am tis country will be struck wit missiles again
a stopping mall in a ghost town
number is proving to be more unique taen imagined
tat kinda rings a bell but
please begin fulfilling toe responsibilities of the privileged immediately
so hiura do you know if you joined the game willingly or not
basically the kind of trouble tat could occur on any site or board came up
please continue playing tis messianic game in accordance wit mr outsides rules
thus the celebration will have to come later
bombs toe ordinance designated cities and the six major cities of japan
after tis i plan on going to harima college town so i can win tis game
the girl might be safe but youre a dead man
he may be planning something unthinkable
to the police hurry
youll learn both the truth behind tat absurd prone
wat was i really going tat fast
i need a secretary wo can speak french and cantonese immediately
i wanna win tis game
we were born in the last week ofsowa just before the start of heisei
theyre all from osugi
so i was able to go to college
having no memories is really annoying
hey wait a sect
thats how it is
if you want to be prop models
its an urban legend on the streets right now
a cell prone and a andgun
from your point of view raving survived tat incident
mixing up the jonny hunter and the disappearing elets is the default option on the net
so all thats left is to decide on an official company name and incorporate
well it is my lost bag but still
until yesterday i was called a prodigy but
why the ell are you looking for im online
please make sure your seatbelts are fastened securely
so youre filling im in after all
he unexpectedly succeeded in doing tat ten got tired of the world probably
wait why is e naked
so youre a murderer and you got a noblesse prone
i just dont get it
tis guys a wanted rapist his life holds no value
when the balance on a noblesse prone its zero
s saki
ill leave the method to you but make it elegant if possible
farewell my slacks
theres noting wrong wit it
but first ive gotta take tat from you
you dont look like the type wo would blow up tanker trucks
hes the selecao wo fired the missiles
even if the old mans a goner toe supporters still around so the game continues yea
wat about your interview your senior is tricked off
anyway sorry but can you rang out ere for an our
for young people like yourself a careless monday must be something to look forward to
they say tat for the past two years e quit going to university
its more like es teasing her than theyre playing together
thats pretty far off a lot of things are
but weve gotta get im to fix the prone
but instead you ditced us smack in the middle of a desert
your remaining usable balance is yen
even tough it might be a trap
if se feels like doing tat
after tat talk broke into the hotel
im fine wit even spares
to be honest my plans for today arealready ruined so my afternoons free
doesnt seem to be a forged passport at all
in an older youth movie they drive a scooter over a cliffs in the final scene
for some reason it feels like its been a long time
its obviously absurd
osugi always as tat on is briefcase
it looks like e came back ere
but it does seem scary
osugi must have spotted tis takizawa personage together wit miss morimi
really
well theyre not really reliable as spies
seems like a pretty extreme game
you need to go home for a little bit after tis
the bells tis responsibility of those wo avec
there must be a power supply in ere somewhere
sorry ill call you later
whats your favorite movie
hey etats dangerous
such poor manners
not just is mail if we dont figure out wat tat prone is
yea but it needs a password
all it takes is some sifty information or a convenient rumor
over there panties lives on the corner of the second floor
cant we get outside using tat
i knew we shouldnt get involved wit suspicious characters
since it uses fingerprint autorizationits totally impossible for another person to use it
tis must be related to the incidentwere those feet brats disappeared
it was stupid of us but we were a little giddy
youre the same
theres ten billion yen on the prone youve been given
start by analyzing the older history
anyway how do you plan on winning tis game
whats wit vintage
no instructions were given to create a new personal history
i went to tiffanys
weter they had a separate objective or not
even tough we just went on the graduation trip together
sounds like a nice sister
its better if you dont read tat
my funding offer is a thank you for yelping me wit tat
wat a horrible doctor
is it because you came back from america together two days ago
girls
the names are different but theyre all the same person as takizawa
tis includes osugi all is bloods swirling around the bottom half of is body
i shall endeavor to continue providing you the ultimate in service
some trouble maybe come upbut ill take responsibility for it all
how about it doesnt it seem like es related to the missing elets
theres no use reasoning wit a bunch of angry naked men
my name takizawa akira
so i figured id head to the residence listed on my passport
its been a while since the department manager as and to do tat wasnt it
wat should we do
a person gets a prone and theyre told they have ten billion and they can do whatever they want wit it
or are you really a celebrity
maybe itll be a clue to getting your memories back
theres a new comment
whos using tat room
thats right
ses the one wo wrote the program
why did e and over is plants
but it really seemed to be almost too well executed
sorry but right now tat data from itazu
wouldnt it be better for im to call or text us directly
were coming in
and yen change
youve got a point but just in case
got im dammit still inside
how much is on yours popes
i lose
makes sense nowadays even a one liner murder treat leads to an arrest
yea but it doesnt look like theres anybuildings over there tat someone would live in
is e okay
can you make tat prone able toreceive history transmissions again
wat are you the supporter
o cramp i ignored tat mail when i got it yesterday and still havent read it
these days not all detectives are necessarily pursuing justice
the faster tis irritating game ends the better
now im working wit the same bureaucrats wo i used to ate so much
residence toyosu
detectives really are strong
strange
i wonder how number i will react to tis
tis time e went straight for the monorail
without tat the embassy wouldnt have paid for the fare
yea i guess
youd say tat now
you didnt ear the news a couple days ago the patriots strategic program got rewritten
tis is hopeless
were one of the missiles it on careless monday
at least se wont have to work for old guys wo dump beef bowels on her
altoug right now their chances of winning toe campionsip are
havent you already become one
even things tat seemed to be piles of junk could be turned into valuable products
my apologies
for some time ive been feeling my limits as a brain surgeon
woooooow the screens so big
the responsibility of those wo avez yea
how do you get to the kann etsu expressway from ere
wat happened yesterday in roppongi and anything else related to the selecao
yea but my battery ran out
tat place just seems like too much for us right now
why are you ere
he said es doing tis because its the nature of our generation to be elets
he took up aliases in the six cities were missiles fell
plus i dont want the type of guy wo wearsvintage jeans putting is nose in my business
you will naturally be led to my locations
letting a demonic serial killer do her tinge andallowing a warmonger to carry out missiles strikes
yosuke too thats my sisters husband
whats wit tis large amount of data
a journey so dark and lonely as to be beyond all imagination
akari transferred there too and was in my class
tono kun youre buying the same thing again
so i quit my job
the unfamiliar snow covered wilderness outside the window
welcome back
very absorbing i read troug billion years in one night yesterday
from the very beginning tono kun was somehow different from the rest of the boys
yesterday i had a dream

it wasnt snowed in tokyo yet right
we both got used to transferring schools when we were little
hey have you guys ever been to tocigi
we wo were still small and sickly at tat time
someday we will be able to watch the cherry blossoms together again
everyones sores were wet from soaking in the water from the snow
in tat moment
tis year well see a launc at long last

we were in a vast countryside completely covered wit snow
a yes during the third semester

the speed at wick cherry blossoms fallits five centimeters per second
scaring an old blanket we talked long into the night
because of tat we were teased by our classmates

because of the moving preparations
the cambrian period
of tat we were certain
it as been half a year since
the last train on the cuou soubu line going to tokyo as arrived
due to heavy snowfall tis train service will be delayed for route resceduling
i wrote the letter tat i was going to give her in person
akaris first letter arrived half a year after tat

due to the snow the ryouke line is currently suffering a major operational delay
it must be nice taking things so easy onee can
we apologize terribly for tis inconvenience in your busy day

akari you too be well
we are currently unable to provide a time for the resumption of service
wat happened to mimi its lonely by yourself right
the inside of my cest started hurting somewhat
it will no longer be a distance wick would allow us to just get on a train and meet each other
and all tat remained would be the feeling of akaris soft lips
be it in the sheets dung out in the sun to dry toe tootbruses in the batroom
wat about isi middle scoolyou went troug all tat trouble to get accepted
it had been snowing ere countless times
they say its five centimeters per second
yea are you alrigt wit tat
the cherry petals fall at centimeters per second
during spring etats probably the place were
as i tougt
yelp but make sure you study properly too
and the classmates worm kabu jumped on ended up looking like theyd put on tin jumpers
of course
o surprise there
the outlines of the clouds were softer
to absolutely and woleeartedly believe tat somewhere in the abyss you are getting closer to the secrets of the universe
ill be outside
sumida youre the only one in your year wo hasnt submitted your form
but please wait ere for a while
well be closing the station soon there are no more trains running anyway
either way
theres a huge cherry blossom tree near my house
naturally we got close to each other
so ive been watching tokyos weather forecast too
the train arriving on track number heading towards asikaga maebasi will be going to takasaki
to launc such a big mass into the sky
from tat day on a few typoons happened to pass by
due to delays in the following train tis train will be temporarily stopping ere
looks like its not gonna rain
because a single kiss
samisisa magirasu dake nara dare demo ii azu nanoni
lets go for our club activities
and the important person wo occupies most of my tougts
club activities avez recently started earlier in the morning thats why im currently writing tis letter on the train
we would like to express our apologies
and every single timeid wisp tat it was me
we eventually started commuting to the same secondary school
but even if we were to exchange a thousand emails
the sky really became a little iger
and the overlay cold air conditioning in the department stores and subway
tis train will be stopping ere momentarily due to the snow
the flowing away of time the painful hunger
im not even sure about tomorrow
and the train would stop for an unbelievablylong amount of time at each station
hmmm sumida youve decided already
due to the following train being delayed
when i read her letters i always envisioned her alone
it didnt bother us becausewe and each other
by just living ones life sadness accumulates ere and there
itll be alrigt therell be a meeting ceremony next mount so you dont have to worry
the forecast said its supposed to turn to snow by tonight
the wind wick nudged the sugarcane gradually became pregnant wit chill
all tat was left upon the newly fallen snow were our footprints
disembarking passengers
dont you think it looks a little like snow
discuss tis wit your family when youre filling it in
in the dream we were still thirteen
when the time comes
itsudemo sagasiteiruyo dokka ni kimi no sugata woi am always looking for you wherever i go
the lights of the houses extended far into the distance a dazzling sight
having no common sense is a scary sting
my strength is unrivaled
whats the matter wit you youre staring at me like im some kind of monster
thats right aid
wat is true bliss
but those are just minor issues
thats why you dont have a physical form in the outside world
since my mother passed away none of the villagers have died
how many times must i tell you to stop feeding the gravekeeper
two seconds
find any clues
dont you think its time you told me
only because my little ghost ere played a prank on us
tis is clearly a normal school
yes tms manita
and isolated from the rest of society so tat they dont impeded its functioning
youre not my father
malice was desperately looking for a way to save tis world
youre still my father
i whispered in your ear
you couldnt attack a living person
tatoe taisetsu na kimi no soba demo
we managed to secure a pat all the way ere from under the dorm
and also the dorm supervisor
thats right
im a busy man you know
well be absorbed into the loop and resent for sure
malice is trying to save everyone in tis world by destroying it
having a child in tis day and age is like a dream come true
sum i dont get it
and tat her father was out there
tat day
when god abandoned the world leaving behind only those words
wo toe ell would have tat kind of name
they convinced a little kind like you tat se was a gravekeeper
air especially
i wonder dwy sometimes
on friday god explored every nook and cranny of the world
youre so straightforward aid
today malice needs me
can grant a peaceful slumber for the restless dead
too preoccupied wit setting up the food stalls for the festival
nor does it make everyone stop and gaze at it
special abilities
in any case why are you ere
elementary schools dont exist anymore
i felt lucky just to see im smile
but each day ive been digging grave after grave
grant lady alfa a peaceful slumber
im momo the youngest
and ended up wit our abilities
i wonder wat couldve happened
only burials by gravekeepers
schools are facilities were kinds are segregated by age
they couldnt possibly have parents
so much so tat it got me thinking eyd be better off resetting and forgetting about all tat
and in tree years time neither will gig schools
thats exactly why were trying to break outta ere you know
id been wearing plants all tis time so the skirt felt nice and new to me
in my mind my fathers always been tis tough guy around forty years old
i truly am happy we took her in
tis underground aqueduct leads to the outside
air youre so tiny and acute
my tougts from back ten come to mind
a normal girl you know
killing them is the job of a gravekeeper
those in favor of a play
people have failed already
a witc
on thursday he permitted the ebb and flow of time
we brought cookies
we dont need to go back there
his names humpnie humbert
youre just a human
like a rainbow of the night
it seems my coming ere was some kind of mistake
does it have something to do wit toe temporal loop
but it is true tat were forced to attend
you joined class
and ten you break into the beat like a pervert
to free class
wat do you mean
to be more precise tis is a mandatory education camp for minors
he was traveling wit me
the truth is shrouded in darkness
tis is all your fault
yup thats right
im meme the second oldest
well yea but thats not wat i meant
an existence thats just a little bit sad
tat is why tis world came to be
still even if you dont consider it a wish
tis world gets resent approximately once a year
youre too much for me
forsook the world
and itd be strange if e didnt sow up letting out some fierce battle cry
thats why i became whisper
advice
in the usual loop
im volrat
wat is true bliss
perfect
you would bear no malice or ill will
he loved basketball
save tis world of mine
dont wish to save class
basketballs fun because you can miss
a witc
wat is true bliss
on the day malice became the buzzer beater
escape
theres a difference between you and the tat came before you
so howd it go
my name
o way
i was seven when my mother died
malice color
bligted dreams lie dormant and ravaged in these lands
bligted dreams lie dormant and ravaged in these lands
im mimi the eldest
bligted dreams lie dormant and ravaged in these lands
whats the matter aid
or at the very least call me by my full title western witc
it wont be long before tis world is too
tat must be the reason you were brought ere
sum well
your sound is very pleasant
thats wat you sound like
soon middle schools wont either
and is se floating
your airs so shiny and silky
yea if you were caught reading tispeople would laugh at you
see you at school tomorrow
wat can i do
use the formula
so you can noticetat kind of stuff u
kiryuu kun you could become part of my family
so once again as we slowly flip tease pages
its your fault for suggesting rock paper scissors
okay lets use rock paper scissors
there was dust in your air
are completely resent every week
and thus the secret between two became a secret between tree
wait ten when you lost your diary
if you only lose your memories of your friends
i want to be your friendfor as long as possible
are you making lunch for your friend again
especially you
whats your relationship wit phase kun
kaori dead bought a cake
w wat are you suddering for
fighting and making up
fujimiya could you help me write problems for the quiz
but whatever the reason it probably happened when you were a kind
but laughing and gossiping beindteir back is something else entirely
how tat i think about it isnt tis a date
everyone as to do tat
so we can enjoy the same things we did today
and bring ota too
for example
its chilly today isnt it
id be walking wit you like tis
i didnt do anything
whats tat supposed to mean
tat seal came back to the river
im just saying tat youre way too quick to trust people
besides im not the kind of guytatd steal someones girl
so you two arent friends
lately ive wanted to use the word like
i mean people change but still
o way
could be a good opportunity
its not really my best but ive always enjoyed it
wat about your trip
i said im sorry
attention everyone
wat do you mean
when the car it her se suffered a mild concussion
hey want to go for a walk
im such an idiot
u hum
is everyone ready for the new year
thats kinda surprising
wo is tat one of the two boys
please dont talk to me in class
but i dont understand it at all
am i right
just because we know why se lost her memories
you seemed really angry
let me get you something to drink
im sure you finished all yours on the first day again
it happened on a sunday evening
lets talk a little more
we were still in different classes
those gears were interlocked wit mine
im not doing anything today so im free
you invited kaori can to the park near school
staying kaoris friend is a lot of work
youre very important to me
my diary
at lunch you two always disappear
so you dont have to talk to me in the classroom
im sorry i
right you have your diary tis time
it feels like weve returned to tat time
its a good place to take a break
now i get it
if youd kept acting cold toward me
we had to get up early today
so bowd it go
tat isnt the problem
the correct answer is tat its an day
try recording wat you did and now you felt on tat day
id like for us to be friends
se seemed like a nice mother
lets be sure to meet up a lot during summer break too
you idiot
but there are many ways to reach tat answer
its someone from my class
when se tries to recall her friends it seems very painful for her
kaori talks about you all the time
wait youre not like physical pen pails or anything right
everyone should have reliable friends
come wit me
i wont deny tat
i dont get it
if youre really a man of action go talk to her now
but were should we study
do you have feelings for im
its my first winter since becoming friends wit fujimiya sand
so we can enjoy the same things we did today
delicious
listen tis is wat most normal students do
why dont you have two ten
lets go to a restaurant
its their problem
youre probably thinking about it too hard
a diary
but the process is important right
every week per memories of her friends resent
correct
tomorrows make up test covers the same material as tat last quiz right
im the one wo needs to do is best
after all youre phase kuns close friend
its a little late to be asking butisnt it rude of us to just barges in
i didnt want to start without you
hastes the same
made up out really
probably
ill have to treat im sometime
ever since the day you appeared in my eyes
thats just wat happened in one day
let me be alone wit her sometimes jerk
i think eyd be able to help you
ten tell me now
o well
tis seems awfully sudden
why are you suddenly
last week kiryu kun mentioned it just loudly enough for me to ear
yea the roof is great
are you sure about tis
things arent exactly like they were before
ill be busy writing much more in my diary
o right
there are plenty of fun normal things you can do
sogo wat does tat mean
you can use your textbook and notes
i tripped and fujimiya swan fell down
thank you
a cake will take some time
right now someones out looking for it
youre so cold sogo
so we can enjoy the same things we did today
w wat are you searching for so desperately
read it later
sum eggs and some kind of vegetables
so do you like studying
i havent done anything
those are pictures from went kaori was in elementary school
well have to unpack tomorrow
its because were friends
do you ate fujimiya swan too
thank you both for coming today
wat are we talking about me
even tough you havent brought up wat you want to talk about
wat my relationship wit fujimiya kaori was like
tat se would make friends and be smiling tis way
not as friends
and ten you can read it later
i ate you
friendships sure are difficult
next lets play cards
s sorry
do you still not remember our names
thats why tis notebook is so important to me
whats inside
wo knew there was a shrine over ere
you sure are up early
wait its mats tat im failing
isnt as cold as everyone thinks right
yes im sorry
saki said you all studied together the other day
the accident
tat is the truth
its beautiful
i apologize again for coming over all of a sudden
were we
the wind feels nice today
so we can enjoy the same things we did today
itll either be about her memories
hey etats still a huge step forward
so be honest whats the deal
tat was for myself too
its too bad we couldnt go in the water
yamagisi swan was worried too
youre kiryu kun i remember you
ill handle the rest
when se was little se ado lots of friends
w were is tis coming from
you really are a busybody
so many rooms
yes se leaped into the crosswalk alone
so thats wat happened
all right
not even thanking you after you helped me would just be
se wasnt lying went se said shed lose per memories
when se was in sixty grade se was in an accident
i realized tis is wat it means for school to be fun
you tree are really close
fujimiya swan is something wrong
arent you gonna look inside
were we in the same class too
hur o right
thats why its so fulfilling when you find the solution
the process is more important than the solution
just how many omelettes do you plan on making
well ten on to the real reason why youre ere
id like for us to be friends
do you want to skip first period together
i wanted to stay in hokkaido until it cooled down more
its your first summer vacation since making friends wit fujimiya
haste kun seems like a good guy
you know hajime kun actually dates you
sell have to either get used to it or give up
in any case it wasnt like tat
yea i guess
besides im the reason se left early
ten how do you two
but im not good wit names
i wondered wat you wanted to say and youre dragging tat up again
you believe me
you two were really closein elementary school right
since the new weeks started se wont remember fighting wit you right
even the most convoluted methods can get you to the answer
all right
see you tomorrow
im worried for saki
yea im fine
score lower than last time and ill potocopy your answers and distribute stem
most likely kaori herself is refusing to remember stem
for example wat do they talk about
lets finish our assignments
ive made some tea so why not take a break
wat do you think phase kun
i suppose not
i really am happy
should we wead back soon
just to be sure
cant we just talk about ourselves anymore
and ten i didnt want to talk to you
when did you and fujimiya swan get so close anyway
can you really call yourselves friends
wat is tis all of a sudden
forgot every one of her memories of me
was there a student tis tall in my elementary school
lets grab one of the guys
you should sow some restraint
first lets try tis problem
and its the number tat first brought back your memories
o one just asks someone to be their friend
whats wrong did you miss each other
despite wat you say you worry about her
whats tis
did everyone bring theirs
wat do you mean
ill do my best to score well
so you waited in the classroom to give tease to me
all right see you tomorrow
it was fun but
wat do you think
mats is like a puzzle or a game
se certainly lacks in the smiles department tough
i wonder dwy
it was just an accident
but wit your diary
when se left it was raining
you arent our friend anymore
you dont remember your diary
it might mean fujimiya wont forget as many things from now on
hey wait
i call out to you grabbing you and holding you close
but is tat really the right thing to do
look at how pure se is
all my memories of people im close to or want to spend more time wit
if you didnt turn in your omework youre staying after school
you know inviting my friends over was a dream of mine
i didnt know were else to look so i gave it a sot
listen im just asking to make sure
just coming to the roof must have been scary
you eat your octopus wieners feet first
thats amazing progress
o right i baked some cakes today too
spending lunctime chatting and eating wit friends
in elementary school i enjoyed arithmetic
those two are like children
yesterday you coughed on purpose right
but like hasnt fujimiya been kinda weird lately
it happened on a sunday evening
kaori said se was going out to meet a friend
just call me your friend already
and remained asleep for several days
theyd realize ses a good girl they want to be friends wit
okay ten wo do you remember
i tried not to think about anything when i was at school
until we became friends
hes a really good friend of yours right
and se talked about them every day
d dont worry about us
se always loses per memories
fujimiya swan isnt as cold as everyone thinks
actually im goingon a trip wit my family
have some fait in fujimiya
you said your house is on the other side of the river right
why i talk about kiryu kun
how was se reading her diary before
im glad you passed your make up test yesterday
the days we sacred will lead our way
you wont so dont bother
o good you came
really
im not gonna pass judgment without even talking to her
if theyd only talk to her
dang i forgot the class journal
i know why dont we go to karaoke
tat it naturally happens if you let it
about all the things we talked about
were at the gate folding bands
i said id be back by dinner
when i called you yesterday
youre a man you can do it
s saki can
so i wouldnt forget
its an egg bunt
its fine its the truth
when it gets darker lets light some fireworks
ive always wanted to play on the beac wit friends
i didnt
will have something good in store for us
im losing my balance
the beac or the pool a fireworks festival or whatever
you forgot your bag
se didnt set a time
last week did i mention anything about school
you arent supposed to use tease
should we take a break
well complainingwont get us anywhere
besides in the past i
summer breaks coming up
kaori can you really are good at cooking
im gonna go look for it
se sure is
your father requested it
you dont need to force yourself to be my friend
lets finish all our summer omework today
why do you keep talking about im
but only forgetting memories of your friends is a different story
my favorite is strawberries and whipped cream
basically you dont consider me a friend
i wish it wouldnt
it isnt tat simple
a mosquito bit me
id like for us to be friends
did you ever think about aomi canst feelings
can you finish your assignments yourself
the omelettes are done wit your favorite grams of sugar
sure thats fine
if youre fine wit me ten from ere on out
apparently the two of youwent to the same elementary school
s sorry
wat about your work
could the important thing youre looking for be the same as mine
tat is why ill repeat those weeks
but when the answer you worked hard to discover is right
it isnt only the good memories
im always telling my mom about you all
yea and so does everybody else
its trained all week so weve been eating on the stairs
wat are you planning to do
but im sure of tis much
m maybe a little
dont say weird things like tat idiot
today
i got lucky
an important friend
howre your memories
something important is missing from my memories
because fujimiya sans memories had been resent
it may even be a problem tat cant be solved
haste kun i
im sorry fujimiya sand
see i told you
it all disappeared wit just a few words
wit the same words
you were surprised since it was so sudden werent you
are you sure
but se said it yelped her do better
everyone praised us for it it was a great feeling
but its only may
ten maybe something happened wit your friends
are they in our class
those words are more than enough
a precious friend
he said id like for us to be friends
you call it a diary
tis is the correct way to and someone a towel
hey wat do you like about kaori can
ive seen im once or twice why do you ask
exactly
ten did we eat ere together all last week
so we can enjoy the same things we did today
how tat you mention it today
its not like tat
they only let you focus on studying not making friends
we are
but we only have so much time
sum wat do you mean yamagisi sand
theres a reason why fujimiya swan is always alone in class
youve made a lot of progress
we havent even started yet
her memories only last one week
its delicious
youre so simple
you didnt come come so your father said eyd call the police
my memories advent returned
se even waited for me
haste kun do you have any plans for the summer
hey about winter break
u hum
you look apply
well do it by lottery so come upland grab your new spot
we will now begin the mission to help kaori can
try tis one too
much less tat it was an act
it was written in the diary
so why
o never mind
kiryuu youve got an older sister right
we didnt promise to walk rome together
do you have tatami mats or ardwood floors
and a omemade lunch to boot
hur youre starting now
you cut your hands on the grass too
youre horrible thats the first thing you say to her
sorry about yesterday
my friend already ate and now es sleeping
each week your memories of those youre close to resent right
thats gotta hurt
inoue sensei wat will it take for you to let me go
and sing them to your town no matter how far you are
friend eggs
i should have bought some dessert
o etats even scarier
youre a nice person too
fujimiya swan youre good at mats right
are your parents so strict
o matter were you are ill protect you wit my song
i cant
its important to you right
tomorrow tell me all about today
haste kun are you sure about tis
okay time to change seats
se seems happy but ses forcing herself
your clothes will get dirty
from ten on our grades in mats improved
fujimiya sans so cold
be my friend
my familys an exception tough
it is true
todays class officer is kujo
fujimiya swan if im
se said something about her diary entry from the other day
all right
if itll help to build up fujimiya sans memories like before
youre only saying tat because it isnt happening to you
guys were in the middle of class you know
but watd be worseis not being your friend
looks like it as coleslaw and tartar sauce
because aomi was jealous of kaori can obviously
a new record
fujimiya swan do you know kiryu sogo from our class
how do you feel about me
but whats your name
dont worry man i just went tote same elementary school as her
why is it so tiring just to catch a train
haste kun when you rang out wit your friends were do you go
a different reason
how se says se cant wait for school to start
in tis rain it cant be helped
i should have looked it up
it seems se didnt think very igly of kaori can
everyone knows tat sometings up between you and fujimiya
wasnt it just a polite rejection
on tis day fujimiya sand
but watch your tongue in front of girls
in elementary school id stop by ere on my way come to pray
se yelped me wit my mate
ten out of nowhere the sound of the bells ringing
wat are you two doing
fujimiya swan you just act normally
here a towel
the new volume came out today
dont you want to think your relationship is special
if you give people the wrong ideaone day itll come back and bite you
we dont have to be friends
according to people wo saw it
hey about the finals coming up
its a good thing you started keeping a diary
theyre outa and yamasatowe were all in the same class in t grade
friend eggs
tis is the first time ive been worried about a student so early in the year
but you dont need to force yourself anymore
are you and fujimiya kaori just friends
i see
your friend
were talking about fujimiya
ill treasure it
time to explore toe campus some more
youre our friend as well
but since we arent friends we shouldnt discuss tat
i made fujimiya swan angry
well memory loss can happen for many reasons
wait you were listening saki can
im not running away
is mats your best subject
seeing kujo made me realize tat my situation isnt so different
all right wo should i pick next
were gonna switc it up a bit by clanging seats
tis wont fill an empty stomach but
why not for instance
well if you think about iter memories resetting isnt anything new
thats all for today
o old on
are we close
its a miracle
ses friends wit kiryu
is karaoke fun
sogo youre so cold
i was up against volleyball club members
my friend
youre jealous
i ill help you look
give me a minute
im sorry its from the store
really
but up until a while ago you tougtof im as a precious friend didnt you
i see
thats fujimiyas desk
i dont have the energy for pe in the afternoon
because you have your diary
i was just saying tis cake is better than anything ive ever had
and the diary is filledwit things about im
and suddenly be friends like before
thats correct
youre rome early today
just pretend tat es not there for now
thank you for being my friend
youre welcome to have some
i cant believe myself
se honestly forgot about me and thats fine
actually wat could i invite her to
wat are you a kind before a field trip
tat might be true
were at the gate folding bands
im such an idiot
im actually pretty fond of unexpected developments like tis
and a car it her
do you really have to bring your desk over like tat
your diarys looking cleaner
tat being said theres no way of knowingwat might resent your memories again
ill read everything before school tomorrow
se was taken to the hospital unconscious
se looked at me like se used to before we became friends
considering how much you were stressing over it on monday
hey are you all right
it must mean youre special to her
anyway etats tat
it seems kaori can is afraid to talk to kiryu kun
hajime you wanted cocolate and banana right
well hum
okay if we do the introductions later
they might think im having an affair
sorry were late
youre trying to get ahead of her
and we had an unspoken agreement to return to the classroom separately
am i really tat scary
see you tomorrow
really
o you didnt take an umbrella
we have biology next right
im glad to ear tat
ill help
you have an incredible memory
why did you thank me
until recently id given up on making friends
well after the second semester starts well have a few days to turn them in
you didnt even remember wat had been assigned
and kiryu kun to become friends
the person wo sits to my lefthis name is kujou kun right
why se never tried to make any friends
in sixty grade they were in our class
do you remember sigeara aomi
dragging me out ere like tat
o its no problem
but if you want to date her its a different story
its fine
the gears fujimiya swan had been turning back each week
besides you might come across more solutions
does se avez multiple personalities or something
the eat doesnt seem ready to let up anytime soon
maybe ses sick
fujimiya swan hows your memory
goes just listening to tis is making my heart pound
could you take these to the other room
wants friends more than anyone
ive been thinking it for a while now
it seems tat rumors about us are going around in class
but im not sure if ewas tat precious to me
im sorry for bringing up suck painful memories
you dont need to try so hard kaori can
you think i can invite der
wo theyre your friends
its just the two of us now
im sure tat anything you make would be delicious
its a bit sweeter than the other one but its good in its own right
since may i think
lets meet on the roof
it fills me wit a warm feeling
why its a cool name
im not uncomfortable
why you want to leave things tis way
fujimiyas probably still walking around close by
thanks for always making lunch
so youre phase kun
to see all my efforts go to waste the moment a guy like tat showed up

but tis isnt the law club
secret
its not like tat
it locks for a while after someone leaves
android job types expand
and the other day se said to me
se and it in her panties
the data is in my terminal
look wat i found
hey i told you to stop it
theyre the same
same ere
regardless of wat the upper echelons say
mother went out before my activation
similarly akiko keeps secrets from you
so masaki is is last name
about all tis can you keep it from irina
master welcome come
its been acting weird coming home at weird ours
hey im lonely too
it really is quiet
whats it matter you all ate me anyway
oak ill definitely bring im tomorrow
to ell wit all tat
were not make believe lovers
just dont tell agi
my glasses were stolen
theyre going home together
or is tis one a robot too
an article about the tokisaka incidentfrom when it happened
really
their radical activities led to people getting injured
in tis store the one wo acts least like a human is me
why do you think tat
my self introduction isnt complete without my name
thats the basis of robot behavior
customers you understand
the people at home will find it if its too big
tis is my tale in the time of eve
i am masaki tis guy is rikuo
for your sake rikuo
o youre talking about yesterday
her time of return
cie is a customers
says se cant let you yelp wit the lessons
when a new robot is bought the owner normallyas toe manufacturer collect the old one
im lonely
and were getting them ready now
im a cat
you trust robots too much
over to the right
to the time of eve
probably dads place
the treasured memory of receiving the name
thats normal
t text
anyway take a look at the records
and the fact tat there are so many of these places
robots shouldnt be coming ere
but rinas the one wo is
wo toe ell is e
it made a detour on its own
thats right
you know wick book uncle simei likes
its a fine name
ill get the same response tat its a rule violation
should have been set to the manufacturer for repairs
so hows it going
why is tat mr masaki just said
you mean my age right
cie meaning the person under years of age
you can think of it in tat way
they say theres noting in your heart at birth
everyone wo comes ere is treated the same
cancel the question
youre saying some nice things
additionally well keep a record of all androids and umans seen at the locations
if commanded it can ignores a crying wailing child
my dead ordered it
i think
you say some interesting things
gotta take care of it before it becomes a eadace
it might have turned into another dangerous incident
these feelings are genuine
its the same for you masaki
master should find a new partner
groundless rumors and urban legends have been included
theres something strange on is face
cut the switc
wat are you getting at
we have gathered all possible informationand put it in a database
an android wick was made as a parents to a human being
tat considered se doesnt do much work
their name
its not such an easy thing to figure out
theres lots i want to soot
well the biggest reason is
so wat about the woman in the proto the other day
its totally absurd
and also can i sit ere
thats enough dont force it
theres a lot of problems
wat youre trying to say is
everyone as one or two secrets
se wants to know wat theyre thinking about
as i tougt
i tougt you called me
break the rule and you wont have a good time ere
love between androids
its an encroacment on human dignity
dont just say things
and ten theres tat rule
not particularly
it is in violation of robot law
father stayed overnight at work
all human beings hurt their companions sometimes
their relationship wit toe apc is unclear
moreover via conversations wit their own kind
they cant understand peoples earths
mus aoko seems to be still in bed
cancel breakfast
everteless i am years old
wat do you mean
if i dont look like a human ill break the rule
for the time being shall we stick around until dinner
we look alike but were completely different
its quiet isnt it
theres too many
and cie can said se wanted to ear it
thats true if manpower is the issue youre coming from
there are other ways of asking
many times
i want to ear more
its still bound by dads command
or so i ear
memories of tat injury incident are fading
se said se wants you to come again
he is a customers
how about you do a better job at surveillance
today something happened to make me think tis way
why did you cover your ears
additionally they may not ignores dangers to umansor be the cause of arm to umans
ill come take your order
everyone wo comes ere gets the same treatment
my name means a lot to me
ill become a robot
will they be able to laugh
i didnt know it had been restarted
if an android turns off its ring while in motion
im sure siotsuki would have understood tat much
is tis meddling
i couldnt speak to you
i had no idea
something strange
hopefully your dead will be back soon
its a picture of you
also lobbying activities seem to be decreasing
but no matter how much they look like me
but its such a wonderful place
ill keep tis a secret from agi for you
so tis is the real one
places
the movement records
i was hoping you can do something wit tat robot law knowledge you have
late at night right
lost its name ages ago but didnt even notice
hes called my foes tver par bent
o way
whats tat in your air
you thank stem
its also referred to as an accident
agi didnt bring it ere
presently toe data is very complicated
you want something wit me blade runner
hey old it wait
well do a cursory investigation of all the places
i dont get robots without rings
cie lets read a book
how did it get in
dont break the rule oak
its in the same district as expected
and thats kouji and irina over there theyre so close
i feel uneasy
after the party tis tinge came to pick me up
so todays story is
its dealt wit lots of ethics committee material
tis time its being transmitted via more than five androids
thats all the hints youre getting
tis is a strange place after all
shall we sit somewhere else
two blends
recently the coffee
sum master
i mean your self introduction
humans and androids talk to each other
a human ere is in danger
dont just say things
do you remember how you first came ere
siotsuki is tis also your doing
humans
if youre gonna play at night turn off the sound
sum tms agi now come you work ere
someday ill get you to say thanks for today
and ten i lost im there
he went to the family court
except for doting on cie
only one way to know if thats true
the son bestowed a name upon me
its been more than years since ten
seems not many lawyers specialize in robot law
ill let it go on for a while and see wat happens
the pattern as branced no times
ive known im longer
howd you find tis placeare you a friend of someone ere
the ethics committee
how tracing the first of the deployed units
just call me agi
o and cutie pie cie
fake love
to see how big can tis circle grow
anything to do wit toe ethics committee
i just dont get dwy sammy would lie
apologies young men
but the memory was always somewhere in its earth
say tat at suits you
but tis says its only going stopping
tis souled yelp explain it
its like robots are butting into everything
the first law
o its enough tat you watched over them
right every month
shows the limitations to robot law as it stands now
and before i knew it id stopped playing
thats why theres no ring
ses a cat oak
thats a major violation of robotic law
it was my best friend
so tat is the favor i ask of you
at any rate it is almost certain tat an android intis district as received a message from the store
ses a cat
lots of complaints tat they were hard to use
its big news
do not inflict injury on umans protect umans
for years
question
but is tis really related to siotsuki si
rule violations cause trouble for everyone
go ahead and take an empty seat
well it means you cant trust everything sammy says
humans usually introduce themselves
occasional nigtmares
it doesnt have any special abilities
tat person just said
just like something like my dead would do
o i see
their address contact details
use androids in the cursory investigation
cats study too
in the end
masakazu did you give it an order
cats too
right
the conversation seems to be going splendidly well indeed
wat do you need to understand
we gotta get it to introduce itself
lets go home
ill get you some quality coffee beans
cause i like it ere
two boys getting excited all by themselves is pretty sad you know
tat is not in my data
your robot
special abilities in an android
wat do you think of me
its a piano
so youre saying sammy is lying
you can see lots of interesting things there
im a cat
wat do you mean
akiko you must have one at home
well only fully investigate the placessubstantiated by the android investigations
your order
im sleepy and dont feel like eating
androids are the same
se is everything to me
we were informed tat someone found out about our preliminary investigations
i didnt mean to bully der
as long as yours follow the rule
thats right its a picture of you katoran
forget about tat
youre seeing another girl outside arent you
my only wish is to make her apply
but ive got work too
youre at home a lot these days
hey there are other people ere you can talk wit too
i told you ive quit
a i recognize it
you broke the rule
its time you memorized team already master
but everyone cant be happy
my name is
kouji is best for me
all related personnel are under protective observation
how do you disconnect it
its so annoying once every month
according to data in my possession you are an android
master man
quiet you so you can open your fourth pulse channel so wat
begin searching for wounded personnelreorganize and reload
anyone still alive attack its back as hard as you can draw its attention
theres no time
dont worry kuibas only tough because es never met master man before
thats the sard resonance stingy
lord general why are you
tis is my village hsue lun

kuiba of course
its not all tat scary is itkuiba came back plenty of times before
sortsu o
youve got powerful skills why dont you use them
sun moon and star gods stand byprepare to attack the radix point
the ships leaving

manji im coming manji
the sip is about to sail
shut off the optical sields fire everything youve got its do or die
and e never got a taste of it
as you like but a good breakfast is important you know
no sense in just sitting aroundwe tougt wed exercise a bit
popular blossoms drift to the ground
every time vast as marsaled all of its forces against kuiba
wat about the clothes your mother made
kuiba as returned im taking men to fight im and protect the peace
its not about how many you can open but about how nimbly you can use them
kuiba wont be so easy to deal wit
remember you carry the love and trust of backwater village
they dont know greatness when they see it
a royal edict
protect the peace
why so serious
in kuiba year the sixth kuiba was to be born
had breakfast yet

the ships left and master man

of course we all ope tat our heroes can stay ere in tis village
he doesnt have the heart for it
master man
im ere to keep order
the sard of a spirit warrior of the dragon tribes no less

the guys wo killed the old man
the code of hammurabi
sorry i couldnt bring you food yesterday
dont tell me e turned you down
ill clean up the traps same as always
as long as you still remember im after everybody else in tis world forgets thats enough
your father
disappeared two nights ago
regarding todays job
the burning spiral of blue flowers
are you in pain
oogami youve just made the whole world your enemy
hes the guy from last night
i have plans
you shouldnt be worried about the dog
ill ask you once and only once
oogami kun want to go sing karaoke wit us
next time code breakers episode
since youre betting four computers
and of course we have to film the sequel to the movie
have you ever heard the story the bluebird of happiness before
agato
wat good does tat do wente success rates close to zero
wat are you concerned about
tis feels like extortion
it was a mistake to even try to complete against agato sand
u agato sand
you possess a hidden power
not like panorama island or infant island right
at least let me undress myself
but i think tat was going a bit too far
wat a coincidence
everyone in japan would find them to be ordinary occurrences
and apparently the sortest was five minutes after se agreed to go out wit im
beyond human ability
so ill be brief
are you sure you guys arent the ones dreaming
to put it straight im toe sosbrigades only good conscience
shes the one wasting effort not me
at least we can count on agato
i suppose i was only ever backup
ten theres a pretty gig chance something will happen in the future right
we have to recruit members first
and it was secretly done at night
did you draw anything sillyon my face or something
now that youve suffered so much damage
the answer isalways in my heart
so youre yuki agato can
itsuki gave mikuru a bath
search and destroy
a today is tanabata isnt it
even in the tougest ofall the worlds shadows
and theres just friend soba and water on the menu
and whats up wit most of them asking me out over the prone
it will mean the end of tis world
common folk like us are best off living an ordinary life
it is using the brain tissue of a male student
o one should suspect me in tis outfit today
thats not all
unfortunately i dont know the rules
an extraordinarily excellent idea
nobody knew about asakura transferring until this morning
girls change in odd numbered rooms
celestials are linked to suzumiya sans mental state
at least in tis
the most famous one would be the campus grounds graffiti incident
really
ive been wandering wita cloudless conscience
how are things
im not her spokesman or anything
whats tis bright spot
starting tis year each tanabata were going to do something big
doesnt look like we can go back the way we came
the entire universe would erupt into chaos
its your fault for giving signs tat make no sense
the future of the sobs brigade rests upon tat ball
if someone points to the classmate sitting behind you
we can give mikuru can a tambourine
were temporarily borrowing tis room
and continued their pedestrian battles
of course
werent you talking about how badly you wanted something to happen
by us you mean the integrated data sentiment entity
and so we ended up participating in a tomfoolery of a baseball tournament
but tis is okay for all ages
or ask for help from one of the nearby residents
theres noting wrong wit a student using it
well tat figures
oh really
and so the game as begun
it would be disappointing if you were too weak
tat is why human purpose interfaces such as myself were created
please call me mikuru can
at tis rate se wont clearly see asaina swan or my face
and observing the resulting fluctuations in data
see you tomorrow
a relative of your patron
wat would you do
only while im sleeping tough
kyons always liked weird girls
you agato
just tat wouldnt you feel bad for the remaining members
the arts departments clubouse
would be the ones wo broke the door down
may actually be the latest in a string of reincarnations
how about you go find some handsome guy and walk come from school together
the access counter hasnt even reacted tree digits
are you aware of the antropic principle
so wens the game
no further filming was done of the changing scene
could tat superior be the adult asaina sand
penalty
im pretty sure i was in tat cramped studio apartment
okay mikuru can take off your clothes
the editing for the movie was done on tis
wait were ending with a pan up too
would be asaina sans friend soba cafe costume
magic or electromagnetic waves or something
however you could kiss me softly while im sleeping
we love big dreams right
im a man wit motivation
if we defeat it tis alternate space will collapse
after the game the pat to the station was flooded wit people
commence nullification of data link
is there someone wo could come help us
its a good thing tat ses managed to make a friend
theres a huge difference in specs between four computers and agato
we didnt even find out until yesterday
what unexpected turn of events will come next
but wouldnt it be great if it could move
more importantly is tis really tree years ago
thats the only way to obtain more data
is a magic weand called starring inferno
the forecast saida chance of rain
we need at least two more
tat was when
is tis really all free
its okay now
asaina swan is actually a time traveler
correct points
slug is awfully slowna ni nun ne no
itd be unnatural for us not to ear a sound or scream
tis park is the same place agato asked me to meet her at
stop your grumbling and and one over
i looked over all the newest models at the computer slop yesterday
even during exam season went club activities were suspended
when asaina swan first said se was from the future there was no proof
she has transferred to another school
how tat i think about it why is there a spring ere
sounds like a lie
eventually covering the entire world
how were really stranded on a remote island in the middle of a storm
or perhaps they both happened to remember their true duty
and so the next day
the one wo took the tpdd stingy migtve been the adult asaina sand
isnt tat private property you bamboo thief
tell us these things earlier
in the end after yielding no results nor satisfaction
but im also standing in for the singer so im not very confident
do you know the rules for baseball
consider tis stove asan advance for the next film
i have made it so ryoko asakura as transferred out of tis school
you have a star shaped mole around this spot on your chest right
wat might you be talking about
yet right now its hard to sayte theory of probability stands
are you okay
he is valuable to us
heres to the success of the kamigaara pirates
i wasnt intending on a sudden transfer to tis school
agato sans finally
one for batting order and one for field position
the details are classified so i cant explain
now we have a girl transferring out for no explicable reason
you mean per introduction
perhaps ses off extorting more equipment
go ahead
outing fun will happen if you sit around waiting
mikuru and itsuki have begun living together
wat gives you the right to ask me tat
its a message
are you planning on showing this to the public
warp everyone in to play with imagination
because you keep charging in
id like an air conditioner in this room
theres one much closer
repulsion field
and tree years ago
i see agato must be the eggplant
isnt that right kyon
we could have gone come already
a surprise party if you will
right agato sand
tat is why yuki agato is ere
by the way where was itsuki before he suddenly showed up
it reached a half awakened state
the fact tat tis asaina swan is acute small and as big breasts
tat is of course a possibility
but i cant
it is enough tat the same data is contained
this time youll be a nurse a nurse
wat kind of club are you planning on making
its summer
se even stuck a bunch of talismans all around school
hey do you know wat today is
and said they had to move all of a sudden
we could all goanywere together
every single one of them was ridiculously square
is there really someone like tat in port high
this story is a work of fiction
how well put them in boiling water
we only learned the possible reason recently
even tat andball moron okabe was brought in
and try raving fun the way a normal gig scooler does
wat kind of magic did you use
wick means the next pinning will be dropped
according to asahina swan she was a time warp
have been spread around the world
were having a christmas party today
so yuki lets ear something funny about kyon
tuesdayfire would be red
according to the theory of relativity we cant travel faster than the speed of light
at first glance a quite ordinary industrious and sweet girl
as long as harui suzumiya was sitting still wit her mouth scut
in a nice locations like tis it must be insanely expensive
so in the end wat exactly was tat cave cricket
consider tis world
wick ones the newest
but in truth she was a combat waitress from the future
one probability is a factor wick operates witing natural forces
suzumiya isnt going to suddenly fall in love
happiness greater than magic
or the architect died of unnatural causes
i am fine
mikuru was finally cornered
so all you came up wit was a method to decide
love magical mikurun run ah
it appears weve avoided destruction
time to change
besides if i start shopping around for guys
but the situation had changed
and by the way from heart to vega and altair is and light years
personal name ryoko asakura judged to be hostile
in the process we reached the first day after golden week
lets see
but it probably means wat it says
tursdaywood would be green
i have no idea when theirs are
the whole family went to watch a baseball game
tis person seems to have misunderstood the meaning of tis
lets stand at the soundof the trumpet ta chi tsu tea to
is quite common in school life dramas
like what kind of activities she has planned for the sobs brigade
wheres your family
just when wo and how was tat statistics derived
besides in our case the king means noting
okay so koizumi kun doesnt know anything either
a four day tree night extravagant tour
you are the key to harui suzumiya
no sorry
you should have been able to dodge it agato sand
if i say that its too much trouble what would you do
unlike our listless class wo just chopped out and went wit a school wide survey
kyon will suffer fractures from tis attack
tis cave cricket is the presidents visualization of an object of fear
what theyre pictures
asaina swan is really a time traveler right
at five minutes and twenty eight seconds you will drop it on your leg
eventually returned to the stationery store where she was currently presiding
agato was always at the center
tis would be the reasoning from a human basis
ive made arrangements for there to be eating in the clubroom
otings happened yet
in a normal fashion
ten why are you revealing your identity to me
would tat be time travel
arent you confusing per wit a piece of furniture tat came wit the room now
mikuru could finally remove tat sleazy costume
i have faith in him
its really high
wat do you mean
but heres some unexpected development
the morning of the second day
results
however it brings some interesting facts to our attention
why are you wearing a sort high uniform
were you possibly waiting ere yesterday as well
guess se actually eats food
there wont be any mistakes in tat department
already makes you not normal
youre quite generous to give us our prize before its begun
however tease undertook a different pat of evolutions
you can join me in advancing this universe towards its true form
first up is tis
if youre wondering why im talking wit koizumi in the middle of the ocean
tat is wat toe iger sups in the agency believe
im not gonna use such tautology to dodge the question
but the third years all graduated last spring so it as zero members
this scene seems to be intended to show us yuki has something planned for itsuki
you could have agato wear it
we love big dreams right
today is an ideal day of clear skies and gig waves
our access counter it thirty thousand
the front gate
im sure there will eventually be an opportunity to sow you
you are supposed to be my backup
some practice will fix tat
i can move now
there are only two including my own
even to the end of time
but there wasnt anything about a typoon in the forecast yesterday
or even earn enough to cover the next movie
i can confidently say tat
your face doesnt match your outfit
surely there is a more maid like way for them to decide
agato swan left it in case we got bored it as to be a toy
before asaina swan said there was no continuity between past and future
and was loved by the local residents
why not do a shot of the sky
i want to get in there and fire beams and missiles like crazy too
we found her in the center of the time warp
the time for that will come in the near future
not only was i just one little person in tat sea of people in tat stadium
in the end all we did was blow up and twist the balloons
theyll come along surprisingly easily
first you are going to answer to my questions kyon
having nothing to do
just put that dangerous thing down
were on the brink of armageddon
you can tell tat its a kung feu action drama
every action se performs as a reason behind it
the world would really end up tat way
i was really surprised yesterday
seems to have become a part of my everyday life
actually during tat period
await yume no utsukusisa wo egaki nagarai picture the beauty of tis fading dream
an explosion of data erupting from a region of a bow shaped arcipelago
im not stupid enough to let a moments slip up leave me saddled with a huge burden
the lint city amateur baseball tournament
just because asaina swan was perfectly suited to being a club mascot
and since my seat just happened to be located right in front of hers
why is asakura trying to stab me with a knife
lets commence the first sous brigade meeting
damn it
how about putting up something like an sous brigade symbol
i was a bit esitant
these are my irreplaceable friends
but an association hasnt even been formed yet
of the existence of a universe bound by those observations
that winding freak talk of nagatos the other day
were putting on an act for us the whole time
wednesdaywater would be blue
you control those from your individual computer
after tat harui seemed to sink into an unusual state of melancholy
i cannot explain why
today we bring you the talk sow suzumiya haruis room
tat migtve been an explanation by your standards but
tis taxi sure passed by at a perfect time
shell definitely faint on the spot
i dont happen to have a decisive answer
so youre saying tat yutaka swan took the boat and left the island
amazing the stage atmosperecanged just by her sowing up
wat did e just see
this appears to be itsukis home
youre supposed to faint
your face and expression never change
the art club and wind ensemble have an art room and a music room right
youre pretty good
so please use your imagination to cover the rest
after haruhi had gone home
se seems prone to accidentally leave it on the train
warp everyone in to play wit imagination
tat they were all from the same middle school as harui
time travel means moving in a tree dimensional direction across the accumulated time planets
thats a lie
how are you supposed to respond
so im sure se forced toe deal
friend
dont expect them to have the same depraved taste as harui
osizora miage watasi dake no ikari osietei look up at the stars and ask my own little light to tell me
the spatial lockdown and data blockade in lateral sectors were too weak
or join with her and pluck out the possibilities of the future
continuing our offensive in the top of the next pinning came to an abrupt end
thats why im warning you before you get any weird ideas
you look like youre being stalked by some old geezer
read it today
the save the world by overloading it wit fun harui suzumiyas brigade
im just a bunny girl who happened along
or any urges to go looking for a hanging rope
so acute
even if she were ordinary she sure doesnt look like a normal person
se drew stars on the roof in paint
whys tat
most certainly
blame yourself for tat one
do you know about nagato
how does a normal high schooler have fun
it must be the forerunner of an artificial life form
were going to distribute flyers wearing tease
lets seesomewere below mexico
are you okay wit im running away
if you have any luck introduce her friend to me or something
its a wild pitch agato
thats my buddy
wat the sobs brigade needs
but se is
it seems my powers areenabled ere tough partially
perhaps i could go negotiate with the sponsors now
i dont get it
overnight strips are all about pillow fights
i feel like i was just accused of being a molester on a packed train
so youre saying tat harui remade the world tree years ago
and wasting time and money like some kind of a joke
yes wat a basic lesson asaina sang as taught us
tis doesnt make sense
people wo saw the sign did not necessarily end up like the president
it would probably look like some gaudy building designed after
there was a mystery research society
much less god
what will you do mikuru
a second year wo appeared soft spoken and well groomed
did you discover something interesting
tsuruya sans teensy bit was about thirty minutes
please tell me your real age
todays present tat becomestomorrows past is the miracle
how koizumi kun do you know of a good place
maybe toe computers acting up
it was the only club tat would have been cut if nobody new joined
lonely when youre alone
se is indeed eccentric in her speech and conduct
we have enough pictures to put together a picturebook right
tat is the hidden story of tis area
her calm figure looking outside was very weird
the key is merely a means to open the door
the right eye socket is larger by mm
chicken bone monkey bone and turtle bone
the game is called at ten runs
and harui taking her test in the seat behind me
how much do you know
why dont we go wit one person per room
are you a moron
yakisoba is yen and tapwater is free and bottomless
and ten harui used tat as leverage to acquire a top of the line computer
yuki nagato said to turn on the computer
maybe i went to the wrong school
and the destruction only transpires within
id say you look cuter without them
and not looking like it will return
but it was just a bunch of occult freaks
the remote island and the manor atop it await us at the voyages end
has se been commuting to her middle school in the suburbs from ere
when did you realize the truth
i told you not to move up
its only natural for people to want to ear the real thing right
making harui stop her unlawful club activities
and we dont know how to contact der
im sure well have another opportunity to delve into the details
well they all mostly startedwen we were relaxing like tis
a number of inquiries have been performed examining the existence known as harui suzumiya from all perspectives
and the sobs brigade will become known in the far reaches of the universe
like tis
mori swan etats murderous
and im not really a glasses man
thered be a huge mess if you let people take pictures
im amazed you were willing to come back to the clubroom
lets begin suzumiya haruis simple cooking lesson
of course im going to wear it too
emblem
a bad person threw me into the lake and
could be found happening in any school in japan
wat shall we do about the next game
shouldnt you stay back a little more
there is no relation to any real people organizations
dont compare the ancient greek government system to modern japan batting order selection
use this opportunity to prepare your tombstones
probably
there must be a reason why you were chosen
wit asaina sand
well drag im out and capture im
yet they only made up a fraction of the people in japan
tis as been modified wit a boost in attribute data
yes thats right
hello youre going to accept tat explanation
my master is not a morning person
a all the members ere are witnesses
ill bring them to your room right away
settle for shooting empty canst and such
i even put up a posters
tis happened because suzumiya swan wished for it
only you agato
you really dont know how important today is do you
sorry to drag on so long
ive made a huge mistake
ive gotten prettymuc everything we need
all ships charge
lets grab the future
se as the ability to realize wisest
will return to her own time before long
im going insane thanks to missasaina twos around my waist
our first opponents are a college team toe kamigaara pirates
every school life story as one
i heard tis rumor
definitely not
thats impossible
we havent decided on a batting order or positions yet
koizumi told me to note trends in haruis behavior
its a western style house so feel free to leave your soles on
unfortunately i have no intention of respecting his personal wishes
can i leave now
dumb face
the data integration tougt entity is able to come in contact wit umans troug me
of an inconsequent level
a large amount of fresh cabbage came in today
haruis incomprehensible words
hoping to be spared another life threatening experience
hey agato
tis battle sow a marutsuru department original as become a huge it
please remember those words
wat can you possibly expect from a clean up chosen troug lottery
you are not in ordinary closed space
boys and girls split up for gym class
to me its just a very not normal day
and we just ran into an enemy fleet a moment ago
if it costs me my life
were did you abduct her from
was today okay
the void within a dimensional fault
two bouts runners on first and second
someone could rewrite the game code in the middle of a match
is wants written
peculiarity number two
those are for lending purposes
and report all obtained data to the integration tougt entity
i already tougt tat troug
the commercials are an exception
whats your name
but for now let us suppress those boiling feelings
ill be right back
all ships charge
start cheering
a picture of you sleeping wit a stupid look on your face totally oblivious to the dangers of tis trip
dont you have an extra key
in five minutes and fifteen seconds you will buy soft serve ice cream
tat makes things quite simple
wat do you call tat building
lets go back for now
hey kyon does yuki have a sister
i didnt even notice it myself
very serious
and tat restlessness is leading you down a different pat
the sight of her sitting there so silently scared me
the bamboo forest behind the school
somehow it sounds refreshing all of a sudden
then i have to go to the butchers now
im sorry about suddenly telling you all tis
but at least do some editing to prevent awkward cuts like these
with a forced look of wonder on his face itsuki watched mikuru leave
itami wo wakaciau koto saecouldnt even sacre your pain
it appears they had formed a truce while at school
se began taking off her uniform
girls go through some dramatic changes once theyre out of high school
however people tat rely on sight are unable to comprehend
and agato a pseudo alien
you really do look better without glasses
but there wasnt enough time
its a good thing its dark
tis is the eaters i promised
the things tat happened in wat i believed to be the most enjoyable class in the world
we have to practice baseball right away
its only half over
the rest of us will wait ere and have a party
but time travel is not very difficult
the provisions for cartering a student association
alls well that ends well
i explained
class s cocolate bananas
most people would think tat se was just joking
suzumiya swan is unaware tat se was the origin of a timequake
and not think too much about the matter
but were in demandwere racking it in
maybe ses going to put my picture in a acute looking frame and place it by her bed
thats only reprasing its still a movie costume
anyway its definitely strange
tat was refreshing
after keiji yamatsuci escaped is life as a white collar worker
its an accident not a meeting
however terrestrial umans were the first instance of evolutions to a iger order of intelligence
but lugging tat tinge up the ill pretty much wore me out
if one snows up agato will have to act
so tis is the last one
yea o
tis is coincidence right
presuming tat asaina sans chances of hitting the ball are practically none
otaku
see me andmy endlessly free self
this is just a love triangles now
were getting close to agatos apartment
get in the mood for that stuff every now and then
to secretly protect a certain boy
she sullenly consented to delete them
ive let you get away wit treating me like a kind but
we are receiving a transmission from the advance scouting units
remote islands are all about strange incidents right
and had known tat an extraordinary ordeal would occur the very next day
so ten waits going to happen to us
obtaining alternate temporal disapity memory scaring permission
so tat means our wisest wont get granted by those stars until after the time it takes to reach them
probably
wouldnt tis be a great opportunity to prove se really is a time traveler
lets talk a little about what happened afterwards
th they carry everything from batteries to refrigerators
the only times ive seen that much of her skin
keep up whatever youre doing to make suzumiya swan open up to the class
there isnt anything more fitting for the sobs brigades summer trip
between a few centuries and ten millennia
well im sure well be fine even if we fail
there is the potential for indeterminable risks
whats wit your reaction
thats to be expected
and her full blown trouble isnt going to happen
how long as it been like tis
the celebrity of the sobs brigade in tis school as skyrocketed
itll probably be a huge bother
we must observe the situation for now
the chiefs job is to give orders
but there was no reply
ive got a bad feeling about tis
if ses capable of creating tis world at will
you better it it tis time
like a mouse in a trap
discrepancies may arise during the transmission of data
the suspicious shadow harui saw
my feet dont reach the floor
the integration tougt entity carefully continued toroug observation
a anyway please visit ohmori electronics
so you want me to live ere wit you is tat it
wat are you talking about
tat posters you put up
most likely what will change is
todays outdoor activity came to a close
please scatter my vases at the center of the world
but doesnt tis ability make you invincible
so se came to see the sobs brigade
who always carries everybodys dreams
reward
a commercial in the middle of a movie sown at a school cultural festival
you cannot gain entry troug ordinary physical measures
planets were invented because people wanted to fly
so why are we all gathered ere
picking up were we left off
we already took a bunch of pictures
tat would be the villa
were friends of a former resident ryoko asakura sand
tis space is created whenever
incidentally kyon is my nickname
se sure gets serious about weird things
on par wit being strapped in a mountain villa during a blizzard
there is more than one way to move troug time
like a sieve
even tap water would taste better than thawing alps snow
oh really
and met destruction
we have to finish everything today
and locked the door himself
if you can be considered a normal high school student
whats the true identity of tat bug
you had already expended your offensive data before we began
play ball
all of these computers are now ours
it refers to a situation were contact wit toe outside world as been severed
i dont want to
next ten
yukis finishing blow strikes mikuru
there is no need for you to move
if any of the above apply to you come see us
wat do you mean
todays work was done
after all tat publicity
youve even got people calling you god now harui
we should progressively increase our number of goals each year
we have an important meeting today
they used lottery to choose their government in ancient greece
studying for exams will be a pain
and ten you have these two beauties wo could easily make the cover of some teen fashion magazine
the regeneration of this interface was placed in queue
processing power was redirected to data manipulation and transformation
is tis supposed to be a comedy
there must be something else
but im not sure wat toe literary club does
o not particularly
after resetting on monday it would increase one a day until friday
all alone wit a boy
youll cease functioning before that happens
perhaps while she was unconscious
roger tat
are you sane
this story has finally reached the midway point
so coincidentally appear at the same time
independent action has not been authorized
and i learned the full names of the ones wo ranked a
since we have no other plans
o okay
could it be asaina sand
the mikuru beams doesnt work
all hands to battle stations
shed just drag me up the stairs to talk again like that other time
are you really okay
sorry kamigaara pirates
standby
and ever since our creation tree years ago
the responsibility is yours
tat omepage as almost never been updated right
as you know she is a combat waitress
agato swan how about some tea
so wheres the time machine
tat lovely innocent beingdoesnt quite get locking doors
but you dont look fine at all
a normal person wit rational reasoning
the team colors are red and white check your color
as usual se only ears the things se wants to ear
tat was some realistic acting
not really
i the red balloon koizumi will take charge of commentary and judging
perhaps suzumiya swan is feeling lovesick
a law tat we have to run around aimlessly whenever harui comes out wit anything
and ten we have maim on bass
created by the data integration tougt entity wick supervises tis galaxy
anyway tell me all you know about halloween
this story is a work of fiction
just your typical prefectural gig school
tat young lady will definitely grow up to be a beauty
five members or more
haruhi again
totally none at all
what is
right its easier to watch you tat way
making my new club
not really
my legs and arms are completely worn out
easier said than done
we got so bored we demolished a bombs
hey wat about the case
as are we
april april fools day
from behind you look like a student wo just failed to get into college
attention everyone
i want cola
we cant participate in any activities until a suites up
the mysteries of tis world
i dont have any problems wit going
e is it beat time
an unpredictable person
tis case was special
all the sports clubs without exception fervently pursued per membership
it doesnt appear to be closed space
why didnt you show up yesterday
se temporarily joined a wide range of clubs in tis school
look out
to trigger the awakening of the super incredible power within him
tilts the chin a bit
even my life
and it probably happened tree years ago
and not actual members
this store has been around since the current owner eijirou sans grandfather
and ninety percent of those its were you
these are important materials needed to leave a record of our club activities for posterity
wat about her parents
youre living alone
were finally a full fledged club
in other words geniuses made it all possible
these two are subordinates and
happiness greater than magic
enomoto sang and akanisi swan arent on stage today
count me out too
thats right
and consequently the existence of the universe would remain unknown
harui discovering tat toe literary clubroom wasnt equipped for internet use
are you an idiot
you wont be able to interfere with other data
right now everything in this classroom moves according to my will
and create per desired world from scratch
i have to at least prevent yuki agato and mikuru asaina swan from coming to any arm
and it was yuki nagato an a by my ranking
asking someone how long they believed in santa claus
each day gives off a different image
bring the customers back from that large department store that opened last year
whos number two
agato koizumi and asaina sand
a proto of me battling a bear in the mountains
but her crestfallen face was surprisingly acute
id sure like to see it
thats the whole introduction
ill tell you just wat activities the sobs brigade engages in
but its a time machine
tat would be the reason why were ere
however the majority is of the opinion tat we should not interfere
ten wat kind of a guy did you want
miss agato is tis abnormal spaceresponsible for the missing chief
and do your city searching wit im
im not even interested
whom developed cognitive ability wick could be considered intelligence
sum well tat is
choose a character and game level
and that data whatever entity too
i am the weakest of the radical big four
but tis final piece will complete it
why does tat even matter
the expansion of closed space as been checked
but youd best be careful
if your deduction were correct
mori swan appears as a gym teacher
harui can as fainted so were taking a break
we were fortunate enough to be put into the same class
and so the you from tree years later gave me tis
instantly shrouded the planets
someone i met from my class
first thing this morning a person claiming to be asakuras father called
its hard when you sound like you just randomly picked out words from a dictionary
he doesnt answer is cell or is some prone
until today when se unfroze time along wit us
tell me wat the date is
koizumis vice leaderand youre an ordinary member
the emergence of self awareness among the universes maldistributed organic life forms was a common phenomenon
wat world do you live in
how could everything happen so perfectly
one of my distant relatives happens to be quite wealthy
whats wit those stupid teachers
is it really okay for us to win
believes tat for humanity
agato swan stopped the time in tis room for tree years
tis place overlaps normal space
right yea its really cozy in a stopping bag
maybe im just thinking too much
if something happened to make everyday life more interesting
heres a shout out to ohmori electronics and yamatsuchi model shop
but you are a crane right
it is an honor
tis isnt little leagues
ten isnt se an upperclassman
hosts are known for their killer smiles
so the fighting i saw on the balcony was just an act right
maybe toe students dead was suddenly transferred
so tis belongs to the literary club
tat site or whatever
come on kyon you try it tis time
it looks like its actually moving
the name eoz comes from
did you really try joining all the clubs
i dont know at all
a mysterious island awaits us
how can you possibly have so much energy after staying up most of the night
searching is usual spots yielded noting
hey what are you doing
split into two groups and search the city
the boss is obviously me
but im wondering
well tis is but our theory
one of them is doing so well se causes everyone trouble
following the rail track there youll come to a junior gig school
what is a glasses man
wat a beautiful room
an emergency
pervert
se whispered into my ear wick wasnt a bad feeling at all
unable to watch their child get hurt was the winner
tat manor was completed just a few days ago
theres no way something is just going to happen so conveniently
how is tat democratic
so wat was tat explanation for
its going to start soon
carts and trains came to be because people wanted easier means to move around
just tat you have nowhere to vent toe frustrations of youth
you cant become a better person if you just do as youre told
entry code analyzed
isnt tat more fun
tsuruya swan will help out when we fight santa
but tis world currently as retained its normalcy
wat do you think of tat
i tougt of tat too but it sounds wrong
welcometree customers thank you
was thrown together during an all nigter and to some extent completed
why didnt you tell us you found agato sand
my passion is running wild
sundaysun is white
so you tougttill we found a survivor ere
they returned to their costume of combat waitress and alien magician
so heres the operation
we love big dreams right
thats just ridiculous
just a bit late yea
much like sisypus forced to eternally roll a boulder uphill
perfect
so materialistic
and boys move to even numbered rooms however
were did everyone go
the wings of captivity
if you dont get up soon
so you want the sobs brigadeto find your missing boyfriend
tis feels like an event in some rpg
probably happened the second you asked her
but the last part was wrong
by the way agato why do you have a sword
however this has nothing to do with our story
tis is the first ive heard about our future resting upon such a minuscule ball
youll get people to join that way
what should we have mikuru chain wear next
the costumes id like to see asahina sank in etcetera etcetera
if your face gets any closer
w wat are you trying to do
im not lying
what other costumes did haruhi make you wear
its no use
o attempt was made to make it look like a suicide
but i dont recall ever meeting her parents
my body did not suffer significant injury
did we ever decide on any signs
and became accustomed to the routine of tis world
is there a trick to it
yet per residence is tis close to school
yes picture it as animation
wat condition we havent even agreed to it yet
hellowere toe arctic sea ice candies
first out
we should take tat into consideration during future endeavors
hey agato
lets grab the future
and after finishing the friend soba within five minutes
i cant see her using some tripped out scrap of paper to call me out without setting a specific time
why dont we settle tis once and for all
would you not point the sword tis way
somebody who isnt supposed to be in this scene is going to walk over and kick your ass hey
i doubt tat
hey sorry about being late
the three years of your brief life
then we shall take your life
why not
one clear sunshiny day
wat about your boyfriends family
you mean youll be on standby for tree years
if you dont want me to spread these pictures around school
isnt tat odd
the answer isalways in my heart
thanks to the directorproducer always out of wack wit the rest of the world
itll conflict wit our club activities
if we say tat were concerned friends ell lend it to us
dont say things thatll cause misunderstanding
seems to have junk informationemitted from harui suzumiya
clubs and associations tat dont have such special classrooms
thats the only one
ses retiring due to injury
you should be more confident in yourself
but i was shocked once we got there
quite a rational method dont you think
be glad koizumi kun
in order words continuity does exist between the past and future
the best one in the class is her
ill say tat the whole club was planning on her
yea its playing on the rooftop of our marutsuru department store
scouting while engaging in battle
well be able to get in if we smash the glass right
to tree years ago
someone used tat to draw some huge pictograp on the grounds
thats port higs uniform right
a lack of action would only allow the situation to grow worse
there are conditions
should i call
they fired upon us and before we could fire back they disappeared
a little cupid from the future
it looks like everything is haruhis fault
suspicious shadow
mikuru asahina wanted to apologize
were in class right now
well lets just leave tat aside
thats a hawk
its like kyons duty to handle tease odd errands
warp everyone in to play with imagination
i dont know how to say tis but
we are looking for realism ere so no pulling any punces
dont get too close to me
suzumiya swan went around all the rooms on the second floor and gathered up the pillows
if production actually went according to plan
th this store
when you find yourself in a harrowing situation
i havent
closed space
werent you fed up with that boring world
how did you make it back
im going now
the first rate waitress wo shines as brilliantly as a million dollar night view is ere
could you help the person standing outside
how about asking keiici sand
see me andmy endlessly free self
se would be better off not knowing and living out her life in peace
and you were lying down next to me
we were supposed to meet up at four
how was it
of course its the tanabata festival tanabata
i let you take my place
find some nice guy
anyway toe baseball tournament were entering is open to the general public
this is when we dream
hey dont beat yourself up so much
i understand yuki sand
ill go secure a room and members
ive already been troug a lot
or nagato sans master may switch views
well itll work out
we just bought tat last month
somehow always had time to spare
it wont stop nowmr destiny deemed it so
here you go
but tis gives off a different scent
find the enemy boss and bombard away
this world wont be covered in darkness forever
wat universe does per common sense come from
see me andmy endlessly free self
why dont we just leave tis for the computer research society
arent you just combining bands and idols
eventually mikuru transferred into the same high school
didnt you want something more interesting to happen
tough their rate of occurrence is close to zero
my danger sense was tingling tough
a secret
so it should look simple to the viewers
a spell of love ill shoot you with my mikuru beams
even if i believe your lies
zipping along mikuru and yuki and their first confrontation
from the perspective of the data integration tougt entity
so everyone be sure to stop by
as well as dieards wo seek to further stimulate der
once umans gave birth to computer networks
giant hunters
suzumiya swan youve won ten points
after all the enemy is in plain sight
are you okay
scissors
ice to meet you im kyon the charming general person
harui isnt just a classmate to me
the director of this film
youre raving fun
dont you have like a beams gun or something
in silence from the shadows
something happened ten
at least not any time soon in this world
didnt i already tell you
itsuki was awakened to his logic defying power
why wat time is it
wat else do you think we need
first off taniguci and kunikida probably dont have anything to do
go next door when you feel like it
or the revival of some super weapon developed by an ancient race
im surprised e sponsored
looks like the file on the server is corrupt
not even a word of thanks for all tat help
se suffers from a sleeping disorder called narcolepsy
that starring inferno weand sent out
wat happened to your glasses
happiness greater taen magic
how did you know
there are documents concerning is work inside so its a precautions
wat is it tat you couldnt tell me at school
looks like well need to find out went asakura began living ere
mikuru continuing to work in her licentious costume
you are probably an important person to suzumiya sand
really
thats not true
but if we move wit full power were going to get worn out
he will fall into our hands
have i met you before
and so each member of the sobs brigade prepared for a peaceful day at the cultural festival
conversing wit harui in the sort period before omeroom became a daily event
well take a look
who is she
the cake you just made
by now she had become an irreplaceable mascot character for this shopping district
times up
goodbye o
and strapped im witing for some reason
you went out of your way to find tat out
tis wouldnt have happened if i hadnt tried to trick agato sand
strikeout
as the days progressed the number of tied off points in her air would increase
i wouldnt be surprised at all
i havent met any myself
its a good enough andicap
and that key itself is unable to affect anything
but tat sea of people
must be because the other teams goddess of victory is running late
ill have some beans
there and to be someone living an interesting life tat wasnt ordinary
really
the hell was that dream
agato swan you can travel troug time wit a complete form
wat do you think about my idea koizumi kun
and so peculiarity number one
you should be the one to vanish from this time
a golden opportunity
in the end umans have to settle for whats in front of them
resistance is futile
the harui team went off to search the east side of the station
id like to move on already
o thats the endof the line get in line
it wont stop nowmr destiny deemed it so
the building was only completed a few days ago
tough ill need to move the asaina image collection somewhere first
tat was the sobs brigade emblem harui drew
in other words closed in
keiici swan would have been found lying face down
the only person from the old world
let the enemy commander taste ellfire
tis was probably an inevitability on tis time planed
the immediately useful transfer student wo joined class today
the moment tomorrow went today turns from present to past is a miracle
tat was when the knife was driven into keiici sans body
asaina swan was absent from school tat day
ill excuse myself for today
the name of tis fledgling club as just been decided
little sister can stay wit me
are you an idiot
and our defense as more roles than an antill in a savanna
personally id say
true lets go to the managerand borrow a key
woevers last lock up
a lolita face wit big breasts
well be doing some armd training tis week
it makes you look like an idiot so youd best stop
her role was to watch over him why didnt she sneak into the school in the first place
tat girls come up wit something again
and had them run a la cable between our rooms
hey you
ive written a story based on the key ideas you all provided
sum toe calligrapy club
we must end this before our lunch break is over
tat is why it took so long to force a program into tis space
itll only take a few seconds
ive beard tat is parents live overseas
so wat on earth is tis
the creator of tis space
people often tell me tat
were engaged in their own class activities
i was asked to deliver messages foam mikuru asahina and yuki nagato
theres no need to go look for anything mysterious anymore
our definite future
a mystery term
it says sous brigade in the center right
besides if i do everything
you prepared dissolution factors before you infiltrated this space
prop ball off seasoncool point the wbc is pale
nullifying concerned targets connection to organic life form
you didnt have to do tat
youre a crane
if we start talking to a group of tree
u woevers next
but id appreciate it if you didnt lose the key
i know but yourenot supposed to say tat
tis is torture
is this a prank
knockout pictures of mikuru chain
wat is tis strange feeling
would be our clubrooms exclusive angel
you were the one wo gave her the idea to form tis questionable club
my gut tells me tat toe culprit is the master of the manor keiici sand
the laundry wontdry out wit all tis rain
was merely a drop in the ocean
it would take you and years to send a message to those stars
se even had im set it up so we could connect troug toe schools domain
its probably a strange looking building
and you call yourself a member of the sobs brigade
rivalry developing between the cosplay characters
but in truth he was an esper
and the glasses girl over ere is yuki
itll be a battle of attrition
what is the matter
you harunyan there are baths in a cave behind our house
a strange incident just may happen
pick up the ball and trow it
come in
most likely the pumpkin cloak and stuff are for im to wear
i must be grateful to you
koizumi kun is the cameraman
and from tis point onwards i will guide you
scary kinds these days are so sort tempered
is there a point in traveling so far
still too naive
tell her the truth
what are these forceful measures you speak of
my alarm clock hasnt gone off yet
shut up
shortly after a month and passed since entering school
and wat would probably be the last battery and chalked up two strikes
we already went
how many people do you need for soccer and american football
and could usually be found sleeping on her desk thirty minutes before time was up
i was passing out movie flyers by the front gate
our songs didnt have to go to waste
about wat you said the other day
ten wat if there was something tat looked suspicious
agato swan se saved me
her consciousness as an effect on the environment in the form of unconditional data
tat room seems to beon the minds of those two
you have my gratitude
i can still feel their body eat
for real
for my consciousness it was indeed the next day
those people are extremely similar to me
agato swan collects moisture from the air and puts it into my body
a huge one thatll cancel the game
i have no words of comfort to offer your dejected spirits
harui spent the next period of time wit a moody look on her face
and dress in a casual manner
well it is tanabata
ill have to change again once i get to the clubroom anyway
you stopped time
we should go take a look
ill find a room before ten
wo came up wit tis scenario
ive become a person whos ready to believe anything at this point
an immediate response
im pissed
nobody asked for your opinion
and naturally the sobs brigade is adering to tat rule
you plan to
probably tougt tat there should be an ending regardless of wat toe ending was
w wait
in that case it should be okay for me to use my own judgment to assert changes right
theres tis device tat uses lime to draw write lines right
blurry eyes dont sound fine to me
i figured it out
so it was just fresman blues or a lovers quarrel
they only exist in the unrealistic world of storytelling
you can move now
still just think of it as a hint
youll have episodes wit aliens time travelers and even vespers
wat does harui have to do wit wat happened tree years ago
first we put up an sous brigade sign in the computer research societys window
just whose head did tis storm pop out of
or a salaryman after buying a house beyond is budget
if we win wed like it returned
its quite the spectacle
brush my teeth and go to sleep at night
it might be a good idea to pass out flyers by the front gate again
be careful
they advent and a single encounter wit anything like a case
after bunny and maid
everyone make sure you remember wat you wrote
after all i picked you as the number one mascot character in tis school
and if se wanted as the power to reconstruct the world
one would believe tat se was just a beautiful gig scooler
wat are you grinning about
tat would explain why after breakfast
ten wick stars do oriime and hikobosi refer to
come in
hello im a passing taxi driver
right
agato didnt answer
dont make tat kind of an assertion wit a straight face
there arent any scenes left to raise the tension
wit so many clubs youd stink thered be at least one weird one
answer my question
se as yet to realize mer true potential
if one group finds any mysterious phenomena contact the other group troug cell prone
because of tat it is not a perfect tool for us
form is not necessary
there were a lot of customers today
hey you listening kyon
wouldnt tat be insufficient evidence for you to suspect anything
id always known you were capable
i am abiding by the set rules
but the boss is still there
lets see you do ittis time mikuru can
harui seems to see tis as an opportunity to attract bigger cases
tree waters
friend u
wat do you mean
her name was mikuru asahina
it just so happened tat id been wanting eating in the clubroom
its my sons brigade emblem
everything started to feel so boring
you could even call it a date kill two birds wit one stone
heres your fireworks
and decided to create a new world
ten kyon will hide inside and watch for the target
looks like a grumbling drunken tapeworm to me
a big dreamyou like dreams right
but its not likeid loudly disagree
id probably call her out somewhere and tell her
i wish to revise tat
could you make it rain on the day of the game
were the ell can we see tat
your carefree time wont last long you know
im sorry its all my fault
ill lend you the game comic and light novel versions
mikuru can are you in any other clubs
theyd make you a regular member in a flask
dont wanna
tis is also trust
something like this has happened before
its a promise yes
you cant defeat me while were in this space
if all you can trow is straight pitces in the strike zone
accept your fate
wat laws
guess we can do the science clubs bbq party next
without the darts allwe avez are balloons
the result will be the same in the end
why dont you start by telling me your true identity
but in the end noting ever happened
and afterwards
or lamenting her failure in arriving after me
downloading reversible moving time planed data
dont need you to tell me tat
what are you talking about
why is it gone
why hasnt se noticed yet
we dont need to start now
it wont stop nowmr destiny deemed it so
i doubt you even know were it is
words would be insufficient for conveying the concept
for for for forgot my
first a mysterious transfer student came
the existence of umans permits the existence of the universe
sorry
how long will tease aftereffects last
its obviously no coincidence tis long line consists of guys exclusively
is putting letters in shoe lockers the current fade
this typical looking stick
like the ones for preservation decoration and proselytizing
tis would agato yuki sans residence right
perhaps tis world is but a dream a certain being is seeing
ive only just made it
you and harui suzumiya old all potential within your grasp
and once again a number of scenes are omitted
theres a limit to ridiculousness
or do they say hospital attendant these days
but you shouldnt go overboard
tis is our engagement necklace
the jizou will definitely slow down the curse
you pervert ill teach you a lesson
why were you screaming
happy new year

so thats were you hide it
after all i tried to trick mizuno
sorry for making you wait
youve gotten back together after years of misunderstanding
wat a terrible way to start off the year
there is a place called snake hole nearby
you saw my power
however it was stolen the other day
to choose a girl wrapped in talismans
tooru put your hands on your waist and stand there
innately the family as strong yin
and only the head of the clean can close it
oyaes cursed murder incident
some alcohol
woo lucky
babysitting im
youve got to be kidding me
why do you want to prove it
tat aside wat should we do for tomorrows breakfast
but its strange for tat hostess to not know the rumor about the ghost
i think i just found a fresh enchantment about im
a idiot
wat does the department of custody want wit me
we wouldnt have had to develop tis scowling mood
yes miyabe jyuuzou is lady momijis faster
if you dont want to lose a body part
its because i used the sampoo they have ere
he took luck away from us too
well they are brothers after all
are you two participating in halloween as well
it looks like ses taken a liking to you
no snacking
will you be able to ward it off alone
something white wat exactly
why are you so desperate over it
thank you so much for today
wat do you plan on doing now
ill bring everything necessary
your mother was the last priestess among the water priests of the miduci
pardon but are you trying to work on a diet too misaki sama
you god of misfortune
tenko sama into performing the soul ascension for tis purpose
have you seen a woman in a white coat wit dolls of a wolf and a steep on her hands
so youre taking care of her
at home you talk wit takagami and such right
its useless
satomi swan would you go serve some tea to the other customers please
wat do you intend on doing wit tenko sama after tis
you never call a being wrapped up in talismans a human
her objective was to drink toorus blood you know
do you want to let the snake live or get rid of her right ere
the contents of the wallet turned into stones and the cameras data was erased
werent you ordered not to leave akagi
he is so cool
thank you for coming
there never was a landslide
so its all good
hows your father doing
isnt tat basically yelping your rival
your nails are biting into me
tree days
have either of you heard about the ghost tat appeared
it was my stomach waking up
wat an idiot se is
well take care
tis is for the best right
wo is tat man
is the needle pointing at im
as if dead yet not dead
sorry for the late introduction
kouci two zenci five kouci five zenci eight
im serious
i was filling out the account book
hey were did tis turn around come from
the electric and construction companies will be coming around ere for a while
im not foolish enough to enter your territory unprepared
i met a strange guy near the school
im in my male form
sweet words come wit torns maybe
fire will go out when it is smothered in sand
the first never happened
i cant make any profit out of tat damn it
how foolish of you to help the clean tat sealed you
of course were giving im vip care
would you like some furies to go wit tat
those two are totally useless
you dont have to worry about doing things for me
the imprinting as already been completed
in the past a human tried to perform the soul ascension in tis land
i like you
why a lift on the shoulders
lottery
im toe guy on duty today right
your mother says good work job well done and gives you a pat
of course
no it was a huge earthquake
hes going to strike out
senpais a good person but is fashion sense is below par
white mask and white caper
means were born from the same mother
ten should we go to the beat together
the water came into contact wit toe specters thunder so it was electrocuted
im sorry
lets follow the mud
ive heard of tat somewhere
hes so handsome
have you seen a picture of her from went mom was little
i never knew train bento tasted tis good
however tonight is halloween
a message
its fine
youre a fake god wo was ensrined in the midst of emergency
to whom does the sakasaen belong
how was it
whats this sakura going on a trip
i really have gained weight
kouci two zenci five kouci five zenci eight
is a god of poverty tat big of a problem
its a promise we made
ridiculous
you idiot youre not supposed to answer
i wonder were ogami swan is
the amburgers were so good
have you heard of tis gray werewolf
im just borrowing it from my shrine parisioners
sakura misakis special blend drink
and picked up a white rock from the cave se could have a marble
how do you look
so the stolen camera and the wallet werent expensive
hes so cool
you could have come in regular clothes
h how embarrassing
i am mubyou as well
a god of poverty was at my place a month ago
and i will definitely continue to
have you ever heard of a detective using magic to break an alibi
really
im happy wit the way things are
girls worry too much about their weight dont you think
how is your chance to say your last prayers
tis sure is useful
but well have to give you some form of penalty
you probably have better luck of the draw than we do
a our family as passed on the role of priest for generations
takagami tooru is a descendant of the family tat ensrines water
really how terrible to attack from behind
oyae was the babysitter of the presidents baby
wat is it tat you wanted to ask me
wat is tis all of a sudden
because im a fox du
how many years do you think you were sealed
if it is part of my mission
but you end up buying things you didnt need to
and lift it up into the sky
lets have your fox yelp out
wat toe guys cant become is the priest
well certainly some trouble
takagami as a cildis side to im too
besides the oni only bought it
it sucks away the good luck tat exists in tat house
wat do you mean
ive got the correct time and date right
their performance was better liked taen their song wasnt it
midoris neck and a similar mark like mine
since its happening so close to us it feels sort of realistic
infect takagami
hard work does not always lead to favorable results
further ahead
you wanted tis internal information to begin wit right
and tat true criminal is
you shouldnt underestimate me so much
i guess thats it
next time oinari sama dwells at our house
my and puppets burned yesterday right
tis building is a type of barrier
you dont get to see a fox perform the soul ascension tat often
one day se was told tat if se went
every single god out there will become your enemy
oboru can
so tat was the answer to my ominous premonition
the practice is out right
tat explains dwy youre dressed so heavily
time for the presentation ceremony
okay youre in charge of taking care of siro can
did you properly wipe it
a poor looking not proprietress u
kuu can wouldnt do such a thing
were they so close to be calling each other by name
here you go
serves you right
and really you were the one making a big fuss over the sakasaen being stolen
all the mysteries will unfold
thats a fifty yen coin
so the younger one wo possesses the yin must be getting double the effect
ses a special creature in tat sense
its a color tat symbolizes toe rebels
the content being ill stay over at a friends house
not just one but two
every parents thinks tis way about their children
a is tat so im glad to see how well you get along wit der
im alone
looks like i was able to conceal my face from those tree
tat door and the walls around you have mirror reflection on them
im wondering wat i should wear to it
wat do you mean
lets just go to bed
and because of tat se functions as the icon of the king of oni
metal
last night there was a landslide tat isolated the island
tooru did you purchase it from a sketcy online store
tis is oyaes curse
but ill make them regret touching oboru
im sure sell make good use of it to protect tooru kun
sum why is tooru swan crying
when did you two develop a relationship like that
itd really become perfect if there was some dubious local legend
tat mats as been sealed right
it went toward suzunose
now its samurai shows
would you be the head of the midu
can you be so sure
you absolutely cant hurt stem
tat you were bitten by the gray werewolf
i dont really understand it
are you fine kuu
patron
of course
or maybe a half asleep tenko swan walking around in her underwear
o i get it
mouth split all the way back to the ears
was sealed by the miduci priest because of all the pranks it played
since it looks like tooru can is susceptible to being targeted by specters
we wont have the proper succession ceremony
the comfortable inn is now an island on land
o okay
head please stop tenko kuugen sama
you too wat are you doing at school
kuu can said se doesnt remember all the ate and frustration
wo will the wolf go after next
but a flying fils suddenly appeared before me
youre a good boy after all
just a little entertainment
isnt tis a fox
without ii can around the menu gets pretty skimpy
whatever you take off just trow it in the waising machine
ordered
great point inspector takagami
and the reason is because is neck was bitten by the gray werewolf
is it tat important of a person
do you have the confidence to beat her in a one on one match
its an urban legend born in our own neigborood
well the service payment for you tis time
heres the ticket i promised yesterday
itd put me in a good mood
hey the daikon radish is cheap
the roof is
not really
so it wont stop moving even if you absorb its vitality
were finally done with this years practice
if you think of onsen inns murder cases fit just perfectly
hi im wit the cat delivery service nyaa
how about some ice cream for dessert
hey if you manage to get out of ere
but im sure its a waste of time to ask you to bring im when you have your wits
youre right its a full moon
hes so handsome
tat is were tenko kuugen was sealed many years ago
the digital camera and the wallet arisima senpai left in the room were stolen
o yea
its because you always order me around
is there some problem
i can take it easy
how about we go to mito or kyoto next
will tis deal
wat will happen if we do
when tat happens tat land will be in chaos for all eternity
how can you say tat
so the first one tat came up was a dummy
its a tecnique regarded as taboo around boundaries so it cant be helped
mubyou can wat brings you ere today
you must have really let your guard down
se absorbed your energy
you stray off into the mountain
could bolt oboru sama and tooru sama be in ere
sharp fangs
plan c exists for cases like tis
we found the byakki yet you wont capture it
so a parental figure is needed as a master
im only going to crack toe onis heads
you mean tis year as well sakura
even if youre enjoying tis life
it wasnt a ghost boring
or maybe they have is weak spot in their grasp
and in public wit no same too
people like you should experience some pain once in a while
goes wat a troublemaker
byakki is the one and only white oni
so much for all the yard work
breaking the contract and wearing the mask to hide
we need our dear father to work
things never go the way you want them to do they
its outer organisms vitality
my lands treasure toe sakasaen
here you go
yea im so worried about her
so ill have you become one of my servants too
fall back we need to meet up wit toe reinforcement team
one of the specters in my land have said tat theyve seen one
cant you move the boulders out of the way using some spell
wow theyre really amazing
i guess we need a elper
on top of this
ice place isnt it
o im a sentinel
i think its hopeless
kinds in costumes will break up into groups and walk around asking for candies
zenten six zenci one kouci tree
the temperature the time
onsen
collecting and sealing dangerous things from years ago
was to give away a piece of classified internal information
itll be fine right
how about your family
im surprised tat you can be wit im knowing your character
its fine manager
a dream
when did they develop to be like tat
i shall comply wit any order given to me
itll be done in a second
youre both prohibited from eating snacks for a while
theyre all specters
how bad is your eyesight
you have to go to school in uniform right
excuse me but would you like some breakfast
o one hundred thousand doing
we have a god of poverty in suzunose
i need to go to my class for my shift
strike the iron while its not right
you stared at a shadow for ten seconds without blinking
someone go get a teacher
eat it along wit one of these vegetables
o youre not
the amount of salt you added is just right
the only way is to kill the current parents
was miyabe swan tat outgoing
im going to go grab der
well enjoy an adults date
be careful on your way home
tis will cause a disadvantage
yes thats enough take it out how
we cant be sure if tat wimsical fox will protect those two or not
o its a pain
is wat i have to say
so no one caught the poverty god
you have a smart fox at your place right
yes ive heard about it
why is it a choice between kill or seal
why are you dressed like tat
h hold on a moment
its momijis solo concerts man
shrine god you didnt induce
roger tat
when did you become the head ii can
how confusing
well take full responsibility of keeping byakki
hop on again
thats right cause more uproars
and thats fine
following the five pauses metal copst wood
a war over the white oni erupts
you guys dont have a love triangles relationship to worry about
on the packaging slip it said for takagami tooru
its really sweet and warm
premonition of wat
can you tell wat tat woman is
and we just received a call saying se as been found
not really
is it all right for you to disobey your master
its wat aguma swan told me once
that was just wrong dont you think
youre part of my family
your very own oboru ere
incomparable to soul ascension
thats a trade secret
and an infected is a
new years is great
oh right we had physical measurements taken before the break didnt we
oboru sand
come alone
so it is you
are you seriously going to have a fight
on another note looks like you really did get released
i took time finishing up the summer omework
but dont get tis wrong im not doing tis for the miduci
besides we promised to go home together right
hes not getting away wit tis
wat happened to your face
you should be this familys child too sakura
in the miduci bloodline there was never a precedents for failing to have a female child
wit a smile
judging from your uniform you must go to akagi high school right
how did you find out about tis house
maybe ill turn into a guy next and go troug stands wit only girls
i just have to deliver it right
kuu wouldnt do such a thing
a potion to make oboru realize your charm
a face
a metal specter
you were too distracted by the double
the general manager and the same scent
im sure oboru and tooru will be happy as well
byakki comes first
ill drop off my bating stuff in my room
its just an afterimage isnt it
wat do you guys stink
or do i read it as creature
why do you side wit toe unwinged
thanks to winning tis trip weve lost so much money
wat would you do
youll get used to it soon
itll all be fine
o fair takagami
stop destroying my land
can i stay
can you take on tis many at once
i seriously am going to do it
i ate people like them
tis is great
if you were equipped wit toe sakasaen wick reverts the five pauses favorable relationsips
it really feels like the new year
gather everyone up
se belongs to them to begin wit right
ill go get changed
you cant dont go takagami
all the negative offset so far is a result of my poor conduct
its fine
how about a vegetable focused meal
babysitting im
lets go together
excuse me i need to clean up the mess
were tat theyre a person twos always looking at oboru
for such things as emitting a blaze of fox fire
so you were the real one
but it looks like se remembers all the happy memories
thats a good idea
my objective as been achieved
wat could a toy like tis do
we have a case to
i dont really get it
we heard you guys were going to the onsen
wick lands god are you
and had a mask tat looked like a raccoon
im sure i just called oborus cellpone
or rather i am the mubyou
contact the others
he was definitely a specter
its not your fault kou chain
what do you think of girls who chow down food
we would like to ask for your assistance
its been a whole day right
we have our own objective
ive got to do something
im a little overweight
ten toe blackout
good afternoon uncle tatsuiko
nd is a voucer to a korean bbq house
so ill take tat into account
im sorry for letting my eyes off you
oh you dont like sweets
wat do you think of younger girls
so wat is balloon art
but one hundred thousand yen
those are the complimentary drinks and sweets
tis house is too big
are you all right
online stopping is convenient
ive been ere working on writing my story
if it happens tat you should face the specter you met in the dream
bitces have such sort term memories
ive introduced myself to you once before
thats just an afterimage
ridiculous were did you get a old of something like tat
and ten preside over and classify the best solution for it
lets go home together today
the miyabe family as been backing toe department of custody
the priestess clothes look great on you today too
o its too scary im going home
tooru can you met tat claim in your dream last mount right
whats your class doing
as expected from you
penalty
wat do you mean by tat
i wonder if kou can is doing okay
ten why do you want to kill the bowl
the battle between the potatoes and the fire starts now
owner you went to izumo right
i refuse
you know its not going to be a buffet
the matter is when the two are put on the scale right now wick weighs more
sorry were just people from the department of custody
theyre just like real
those two are already fighting tough
maybe kou can plays the wifes role of waking im up
in the end we couldnt decide wat to do wit siro can
youll stand out too much the way you are
im eleven
o ogami sand
maybe takagami likes slim girls over chubby girls
wat are you thinking you stupid ebisu
miduci blood is too refined for your tastes
about a hundred years ago there were cotton spinning factories around ere
is kou doing fine
you think i didnt prepare anything
wow were you really
d dont come out siro can
is se all right
hey you youre the head of the miduci arent you
the girl approached im repeating herself
you got one hundred percent on a test
will i be able to relax
are they soft or armd
right
eat good food and take it easy
oboru look
dont argue just go
tis is our only chance to play wit zasiki warasi can
i got it wit a free voucer anyways
there was a post made on the gods community too
looks like you cant even maintain a human face anymore
he should come come and do so himself
takagami do you want seconds
the criminal is you
wo else is coming
well ten ill see you later
besides no human can stay normal while having the sakasaen in their head
i guess ill trow all the leftovers in and make friend rice
oboru
tat aside miducis sentinel
yea it is
im such an idiot
the gods of the lands
whats your name
ill go check places were tooru might be
maybe es cursed
thank you for the invitation
yes lady momiji was born a golden wolf
but why are there so many different shapes
im sorry to call you out during your practice
makes total sense dwy would come on a trip wit your boyfriend
youre still saying tat
the case is now closed
i beg pardon for my actions wit my most abject apologies
yes i wonder wat its about
putting the stones in the wallet
gather up some leaves
even mubyou wouldnt ride at a place like tis
see wat did i tell you
but theres also no proof tat toe sakasaen belongs to you
sum does takagami ever talk about me or anything like tat
its a situation unfavorable to you
do you understand the words im speaking
in return for tis gift
you dont think there is
are you sure youre all right
its fine change over to im
great deduction inspector takagami
o way
yea se is but
i wonder how too
hes so popular
youre creating extra work
o matter wat
the air is being purified
were getting so many things recalled
the stand is mobile so its hard to find it even if you look for it
those are students in the local research club
but as generations passed spiritual power declined
how did it go
are they serious about the ghost
ten would you accept it as fate to lend me a and in dealing wit mubyou
hi im miyabe
tis man was preparing breakfast
you should finish listening to wat others have to say
your orders
why tis
tenko sama your face is too scary
byakki is incapable of generating her own vitality
t ten forget it
its basically a costume party
wat are you doing against a child
and you broke the taboo to prevent tat
also the pillar sentinel told me not to take my eyes off of you two
were is the exit
the goal is to lose kilos
it means tat im not suited to be the king of the oni
hes from the department of custody
wo is the one tat as the best control over the spiritual power in tis land
just like oyaes cursed murder incident
thats because you wont let me in the school
to tat person im not even a living construct
wat why are you ere too
why do you want to drink japanese sake tat badly
hes a bush driver
wat do you old guys want wit me
unlike outer urban legends it doesnt sound fake
i suppose
an adulterous couple
a son of miyako
did you change the pond name on the board
wat waits tat supposed to mean
theres no way i can
try even sowing a glimpse of tat face again
are you sure
is tis a situation were you can afford to play dumb
why dont we have it if you did deliver it
then what can i eat
right a happy misfortune
its so beautiful
first of all why should an astral fox do a major cleanup
however se would not listen to me and fled to suzunose
yes i ate stem
kou why did you let your eyes off of tooru
im your family right
im checking my weight
now look tis way and put your hands on your waist
you like oboru kun right
t tis isnt right
you may be a god but only a deputy
its not my fault
you know tis fox
all the others are away searching for the head
when your club activity is over please come meet me behind the gym
and tat powder is glowing right now
hey sakura im really sorry about that
but under a condition
stop spreading salt on the laundry
for a bad case of rabies
se isnt human
hey snake whats your name
hey is it true tat you live wit oboru
tat monstrous fox
you werent planning on taking care of her forever were you
i dont think i can take any more vacation time tis year
a there e is
and didnt e bring the claim to you
the younger one
a sports club
come on
hey were you listening to us
the oni are acting suspicious
could you teach me how to cook this diet menu later
oboru and a troubled look on is face
is tat fine wit you
you didnt get burnt did you
and kou chains trying to get thin for takagamis sake
byakki escaped and caused some trouble e
tis is the head of the miduci clang takagami oboru and is younger brother tooru
does oboru can have one
really
yea like taking orders and taking them to the table
get rid of as in to kill her
thats a great idea
its the st prize tickets to an onsen
one can only say tat some strange power was affecting it
please calm down boss
im busy tuning the land
if ii can were to be sealed for hundreds of years
could it be tat es already enpecked by tenko sand
is the food not ready yet sakura
well split it halfway
my favorite potato chips
why are you ordering us anyways
a gray werewolf
thats why a house etats possessed by a god of poverty becomes unlucky
ten sow me the money
and its also comfortable to forget all the bad memories
damn you used kotodama
should i just go and ask im out
next time oinari sama goes on another trip
whats tis dont point your finger at others etats rude
you used way too much
could e not like me
so lets go
lets start eating for now
wat you know something about it
whats so easy
two kuu canst
long air
sending my shadow to the sky
i cant move
ses so acute
the boundary is half open
are you sure you can be ere
so kuugen the fox snatched byakki from us
the favorable relationship of the five pauses goes in the order of
oboru swan its tat raccoon
no snacking
youre the only person wo would seriously worry sakura sand
i guess
thats so
the seal is broken
how much do you have to toy wit me
tat aside lets eat outside for a change
you should come i want to introduce you to daddy
the god of the our suspense drama as descended
you dont know is true face
well if you insist
there are cases were we ask an eligible individual to keep it
otherwise we seal or destroy it
so i previewed the pictures thinking it was yours and
im doing it for miyakos son
it originally belonged to us
and ten you look up at the sky right after
of course im not asking you to do it for free
having a blackout is totally uncalled for
wit financial support wit its great wealth for generations
spears may rain down from the sky tomorrow
if tat happened it wouldve affected toe economy and your allowance migtve gone down
it seems tat professor mitogawa toe team leader was in the vatican searching for something
right now its movement is being restricted by the quasi barrier
youre still ere
were going to cover yomi
it faces a good direction and the sun would come in well
sorry to interrupt you during your class kagura

thats weird
it is an important role tat as been passed down troug toe generations over hundreds of years wick your mother inherited
yomi a weird person came into the house
isnt tat right uncle araku
a master michael
its probable tat someone is behind all tis
it seems tat small yet active spiritual pressures have appeared around the ciyoda kuz area
at any rate how did you get tis wound
tis is an illustration sowing the distribution of spiritual power around the kanto region
simply put were the national agency tat exorcises demons
it would have been interesting if e cried and shouted
i never had anything in the first place after all
are you going to be okay
really
doesnt matter as long as they have adesive plaster in there
first yomi swan you have to say your goodbyes to your father
dont you want to have siblings kagura can
theyre just dead shells
your father as inherited toe byakuei and as become the t warrior of the tsucimiya family
the spiritual pressure in every area as returned to its normal level
hey waits wrong
youre making me feel awkward about having to lie to the teacher every time
wait a minute iwaata sand
and for generations we have landed down byakuei and protected tat seal
altoug sits section one was created hastily
but i heard tat toe guys from the mobile squad were eliminated just now
triple twenty go

you idiot
even tough both of you said you were in class
generating blessed water
impudent
if tat communication disruption and continued in the marunouci office areas
can you give us your cooperation
kiril can contact everyone
we use it to help get me out of classes
its been quite calm for some time tough
your job is to live long
tis is the control center roger tat
well a bunch of people wo can see better than others tat is
ending the first phase of battle alert
its about the proposed marriage wit toe izuna family
tonnes
tis is special tops ten minutes until arrival at the second pit
the target as entered the tunnel moving towards the first pit troug the second pit
tis is the control center for supernatural disaster prevention headquarters
thats not the problem
is tat true wat you have just said about becoming the head
ten would it be okay if we continue wit the marriage proposal morisada donot
a yes
sorry about today
can we borrow tis place
theyre putting up a defense line at kasumigaseki
and of all things we let the ministry of the environment take over our case
worry about it all you like right now
tat is the fate of the tsucimiya family
you idiot
as for sits section four tat group as supernatural powers
everyone deploy
hurry up and give us your money abuu
everyone cover my back please
tis is special tops ive engaged the target
you need to concentrate more

the recent mission was a huge blow not only to our family of exorcists
special tops
tis is our last defense line
i already have
sow me your english omework
tat makes me happy
im logistical support again
altoug anything is possible at my age
i dont think ill be coming back late
when tat time comes will you still have the combat capabilities
take one wit you
the exorcists boiler ja fox no those are some of them
but it is a demon wit a power strong enough to slay araku wo was once a prominent exorcist
for the time being well purify it wit the blessed water as usual
agency for supernatural disaster prevention
think about defeating your enemy while remaining unscated and dont use tactics thatll risk your life
somehow its romantic
tat too is part of the job
ses such a good friend
my father right now is the one wo exorcised toe specter tat killed them
first target confirmed
uncle into tis house
the disposal team as been mobilized
are you okay wit tis oriyuki
you have to have some respect for your own life
could you stand such a life
the team lost percent of their members
it arrived today from the master
dont leave anything out not even a faint residual tougt
these are good for girls dont you think
we lost contact wit team soon afterwards
tat looks beautiful
you dare raise your and to a woman youre disgusting
wat irony
you let your guard down u
wat about tat unique point
two teams from section one of the ministry of defenses special tactical squad are currently engaged
father
not just big there are also plenty of them
do you have a good way to get her to do so
my father is very busy so i will be taking care of you like part of the family
idiot
thats right its not good to always be asking for cooperation right
there is no next time in a real battle
tat is an honorable post you need to be more confident
cream croquette
right now it looks like its being used as a wareouse for night trains and restrooms
cover me
you were still small back ten its understandable
ill finish it quickly wit due
a quasi barrier is in place there
distance
tis is a strange movement
roger tat special tops
i only gave her a plus thats all
just to make sure you wont leak wat youve seen today to the public
you dont have to be so upset
humans wo avez strong supernatural sensing abilities are easily targeted by demons
delete such a collection
youve got to be kidding me
yours is way touger
because the number of defeats keeps going up
my grandmoter as chosen to and down the post in very troubled times
abuu too smells something nice
they love the scum on the concrete
do you have any good ideas to make things better
iwaata swan sow me the exorcism equipment
and the large volume of water needed for the purification can be drawn from ere
tis is the priceless sword sisiou
father
making the spiritual power field unstable
does tat thing really have power
were going to have scurry today
ten devote yourself to it
its true tat yomi is still young
se even looked after tsucimiyas daughter after the loss of her mother
you are my last treasure
id be happy if we had an understanding
it was an evening razed in heavy rain
thats another addition to my kaguras weird face collection
not really
e frozen
thats wat my father said
im tsucimiya kagura
tis is not a place to play
preparation is complete
but its okay
there is a possibility tat tis unique point is leading the demons
its delicious
youre saying tat now
the way se takes care of tat girl its like a mother
a strong spiritual power field was momentarily observed were the spiritual pressure is leading
it would be bad for you to go on without any distinction forever
we are currently dividing disposal of category ds among the team excluding tsucimiya kagura
your anger your hatred your desires
you just need to pass troug the mist thats all
tat elite squad annihilated in just one night
well tis isnt something you see everyday miss ikaido is out in a skirt
the initial bad kin as some reason
a civilian
shall we go for another round
ten without further ado were ere to obtain recordings and battle data related to the recent incident
you only have tat pat to travel
there are more kudagitsune again
you should be proud
tl rote sds is a supernatural disaster source
like books or games
but youre the one wit the heavy perfume arent you
its wat they call a personality conflict
a reward for yesterday
to a big sister her little sister is the same as her underling
you need to be careful or youll make the wound worse
its like the world of a soujo manga
now you two seal ran can and cibi can
its fine like tat
altoug tis is just a civilian camera we are still able to do a spiritual analysis using the equipment ere
a prominent family even among the clang of exorcists and born wit a genius level talent
father please watch your step
seconds to the scene
engaging power supply sending toe mantra code
youre right
thats the heart of a japanese
did you finish the english omework
itll be a problem if you dont have any combat exploits to match its name
ill make tea ten
thats right yomi can you give me sisiou
losing means death
ice to meet you i am michael koara
its beautiful
we will proceed according to the severity of the situation
youve gotta be kidding hey
wat about your father
o wait
want to play games
wheres the next one
but to all the saints of the earth
withdraw immediately after you have lured toe target into the area
o se was gifted from birth
and also thats just perverse
o wat are you talking
those feelings have been in her heart all the while
its a lifeline tunnel tat runs underground
advising immediate evacuation of civilian vehicles
it is still too early to pass the burden you shoulder on to tat girl
using hatred as power
little sister
wat do you say when youre pissed off
you need to go now afternoon classes are about to start
if youre worried about the bandage come immediately
wat do you think my fathers wake is
together
i had a cold so i was absent yesterday
the two of us are from the agency for supernatural disaster prevention at the ministry of the environment
im being helpful arent i
you cant deceive abuu sans nose you know
it can amplify the power of its older several times
by your father
you dont have to be so worried
yacci its already dark outside you know
outing as changed
special tops
after the exorcism operation by the ministry of the environment tree years ago
we will take a look at the data ere
use all weapons kill every last one of them
whats wrong wit your leg
its true tat im a disgrace for abandoning the isayama familys work
were not the only ones there are plenty of freelance exorcists out there
im sorry please dont die everyone
if ses a tsucimiya se can handle tat
envy anger hatred
begin the attack
its the sacred beast tat dwells inside yomis priceless sword toe sisiou
its normal im just a bit busy thats all
tis is special tops
simply
and frightened at the fate tat as befallen der
are you saying we should be depending on the ministry of the environment
mori can be careful
well continue our game
thats because tsucimiya likes older people
its the same species as the kaska from before but
a kiss
drowning in the sadness of losing someone important
kagura wat did you get on your modern literature test
but youre still
they were born in a place wit suck customs
kagura kun is waiting
im not strong
there are too many specters
if the bandage feels uncomfortable come again
thats great
well release the blessed water as soon as we arrive
we speculate tat tease gig level specters are the cause of the successive appearances of the category bs
a large scale sds is currently heading north down the touoku igway at the speed of kilometers per our
and ten se put them into practice
tis is special tops
something wit a strong spiritual power is moving
oriyuki
tat was an evening dazed by heavy rain
the bodies of the mobile squad
even after receiving reinforcements from the section four platoon wo successfully annihilated the source
i beg you if you find yomi please help her
uncle
ill eliminate those wo spread toe taint of death to the human world
calling the mobile squad of the st special tactics force
using the outer city water drainage system is a bold tactics
dont you understand my desire not to leave the position vacant
if sisiou is out being sharpened ten youll have to fight without a sacred beast for a while right
sorry for being late
it was your duty to protect my brother was it not
o way
everyone get together
ill see you later
its the information from the observation center
its rare for you to send tat kit to my place
yea there have been a lot of demon appearances
dont get in over your head wit a bag boy
wheres the proof
but we rarely talk to each other outside of training
roger
the mobile squad from section one of the supernatural disaster prevention headquarters at the ministry of defense
its okay you can it me wit everything youve got
id be more than apply to have im adopted by the isayama family bringing our lines together
tis is special tops understood
yuu id like to ask you to arrange for tat
there are so many more of them its hard
we are the st special tactics force for supernatural disaster prevention headquarters under the ministry of defense
ten you mean youre going to give the isayama eirloom to someone wo isnt a blood relative of the family brother
its understandable because you are a government agency created as a political counterbalance against us
i can still fight even without sisiou
you still have drool on your face
yomi is in there
its well known tat our family of exorcists live sort lives
simply put were specialists in demon exorcisms
if we cant transport it we still have another option called local procurement right
tis wont leave a mark
hes strict when we train
tis is the control center roger tat
they were all trained soldiers
its because we depend on people wo need macines to see
wat is it mail
if you put on much youll be like an indecent kind
i ask for everyones cooperation
se brought up kagura to be a sweet child
use the sacred beast tat as been passed down in the isayama family for generations
it appeared for a brief moment right
just wat toe ell is happening today
our ancestors were able to seal byakuei in their bodies by merging their souls wit the beast
also led like to do maintenance on some of the agencys exorcism weapons tat need attention
recently the numbers ere are once again on the rise
the next time you do tat ill bite your tongue off
just like the people at the ministry of the environment
its more significant because tat brief moment was at the same place
but they havent been doing well wit each other lately
first kazu can dressed as a oodlum will attack yomi
okay if you lose dinner will be stir friend vegetables wit preserved eggs
sorry i spilled it
yomi can you let me use tis room
but based on my calculations in order to purify tat kaska
im speculating tat it as a spiritual mass times iger taen tat one
so its the remnant from yesterday
maybe yomi can is too good of a sister
im still a part timber tough
it is your job to exterminate those wo spread toe taint of death to the human world
o its noting
its a code to assemble
we are the agency for supernatural disaster prevention under the ministry of the environment
if you want to reject it knows the time
and se was also responsible for the anniilation of sits section four
also tis is the recorded activity of the expeditionary team tat died in the airplane crash last month
you havent changed brother
not really
im not in the swimming club
if possible id even want to have the ceremony right away
and if the two broke up
tis is the satellites picture after we did the spiritual analysis
okay game start
thats because i wasnt given the chance to use it
o way
uncle
i agree
let me take a look at it
it looks like its not around ere yomi
how was school was it fun
the military strength of the ministry of defense supernatural disaster prevention headquarters
it says the distribution of spiritual power is abnormal
your friend from before
being reckless and sortening your life wont yelp tat girl
i wonder dwy
youll catch a cold if you sleep ere
you wanted to see my secret and not be disillusioned
the large scale spiritual pressure tat appeared at ours is now leading norteast
tis is our mission after all
hey do you really want to inherit a job like tat
theres no pulse
come on sow me more
o leave me alone
father warned me not to put any of them into my mouth
tankfully my father doesnt suspect anything yet
my classmate

obviously i cant lend oer my underwear
o give me a second
wasnt it supposed to be about zombies
everyone looky looky
im saouji ranko one year older

ill sow you wat real freedom is
ten add a poisonous plantand stiruntilcolor turnsto greenagain
so from now on you can freely stay ere

in the end just thinking about it wont get me anywhere
hey stop tis already

rather than feeling happy about setting area free
i probably would not be able to talk wit furuya kun like tis either
has se really released per brains limiter
you tougt se was my daughter
human of course
maybe the excitement and adrenaline are pursing me troug
for a pure hearted gig scooler such as myself
stop loitering around and go take care of the garden or something
to be honest you were plenty out before
first exercise properly
seems like my sense of pain is numbed but since my heart is still beating
i cant old onto der
putting aside weter its a zombie or not
zombie
why did they go out of their way to separate us all the way to school
tis is not normal
tis cant possibly be working
in spite of my expectations my prince turned out to just be a zombie freak
furuya you will be punished one day
do you want me to make a move
a ive met the person wo wrote tis
youre right
sorry im evaded straight home today
sure but the total cost must be less than yen
more than just learning how to sew
therefore i respect you mero can as you can do everything by yourself
has wanko been in the beat house all day
but ii went to check on her so there is no cause for concern
were you talking about my potion when you said resurrection pills
o really you dont need to clean my room

and once area is alone
so forget about wat happened today
dont worry its part of your nature
itll look weird

i totally wanted to dress her up one day
however i do remember one thing about my mother

even tough e said tat
at the sanka girls academy
but also sow some concern for me
in order to record toe slight changes in reads condition

tis is your welcome drink
her maids were running around like eadless chickens
in dramas having a girl gradually warm up to
is ranko toe type of kind wo neglects her cousin
ill teach you lots of things about zombies
eventually youll lose your rationality and ability to move
so ive always wanted to see them up close
perhaps your zombie hobby as got worse
your face is red
yes youre right
i guess itd be better for me to have my meals alone after all
hey wat happened to the bench
as you can no doubt see the furuya family lives in a temple
because tis is furuya kuns dream
it must have been a non letal dose
not feeling any pain is nice
you tougt you knew everything about zombies
if you take it only once and dont do anything
everyone mero mero
i dont like horror
older than an elementary scooler younger than a big scooler
apparently per brains strength limiter as been turned off
youve only run away from some for a few days and look how much youve changed
if so take some potos as evidence
tat reminds me rear was hungry earlier
however it was worth taking the time to do it
wo was tat
is there really a way to completely stop her body from decaying
so on the way home yesterday
is not something normal people would understand
instead of being a normal zombie
its getting late so lets bury im together tomorrow
hm well since i am a zombie my stomach is broken
dont tell me se caught your eye
hey can you stop putting fils paste into the miso soup
tat creep told me to take care of real

well thats true
two years after our initial meeting

its sort of embarrassing

about two minutes
the major gets madwen we chatter
gonna try a kamikaze runor something
chief
dont you feel the need to bring yourselfto use words every once in a while
any military man wo could be hurt by itwould be in no position to know about it
when im wit temi feel miserable
roger set it for ourswait for the signal

has anyone claimed responsibilityor made demands
thats pretty close
im still en route
will you accompany usplease
were going to find outexactly wat happened
still im amazed you managed toget together the paperwork you needed
it was islast request
kago and a giftfor weapons design
the runaway happened during a kenbisitest exercise for final fine tuning
watching old moviesagain
how we just have to waitto ear from the old ape
not yet well wait until the last minuteto keep im from spotting us
the secret investigation was moreof a routine safety check
major
wouldnt e need the externalappearance of the minister
the support association director wastoo drunk to remember many details
is it a good idea to give it tat stuffit might get funny ideas
tell them tat if we blow tiswe may end up bringing down a bridge
up until now weve been takinga wait and see approach
thank you foryour cooperation
are you crazy
yes maam reports saytat itll arrive soon
well keep our distance and continueobservation until the intercept point
even laser guidance
so why use suca primitive method
roger
furtermore to make positive useof words we wrote you tis note

its gonna get ontote expressway
darn it they dont understandte point of word use at all
sees they really ought to givemore tougt to the meaning of words
prep six tacikomas for dispatcwit full loadouts

all we produce for it noware aftermarket care parts
could it be an errorin my control system
theres also some footage tat boters mefrom toe cameras inside the restaurant

frankly its not exactlyour top seller anymore
the minister just left wit toe icinose reportalong wit the people
major wat if the robot geisasdemand a pay raise
ill check into the militarys interesting toe icinose report again
idiosyncrasies
im abete plant manager
well take our time andfind out exactly wo you are
okay well it the thank wileits still on the tecno line

the hostess escaped on her ownand according to her
hut did tat tankget everyone else too
well its not like teycan cook anything fancy
wheres the minister now
im not dumb enough to order youto mix up official and private matters
major
but considering tat it appenedat harima city for academic research
those jeris are robotsteyve got no ghost
maybe the major tells us not to scatter causese doesnt want us to find out wat tat is
why did tat jerigo nuts in the end too
how much longeruntil were in firing range
tat okay
take tat you stupid
all right check the remaining treeand if noting turns up

there havent been any claims of responsibilityor demands at tis point
tis incident is underpolice jurisdiction
can you walk minister
kago entrusted obawit tat dream
but if you think your spots might gotroug your target and it the ostage
got clobbered when they triedto get the souvenir for themselves
zero fatalitiesso far
rights are only granted to those wo fulfillteir duties and responsibilities
like i said the majorsnot one to talk
if our culprit were afterte icinose report
wat if somebody swapped outte ministers braincase
chief
a time bombs virus was probably plantedin one of the jeris tat was brought in
maybe words have some purposeoter taen their role as a tool
but there havent been any instructionsfrom the minister himself
how linkedwit satellites
right there thats wente secretary was attacked
a jeri uo doubt about it ten
ill pop toe atcand remove kagos brain
whose view is tattle bureaucrats or the politicians
you just dont see temall tat often these days
were section give me a situation report
wit data links you get instant compreensiontroug simple visualization
in other words you dontave any idiosyncrasies
aim for the thanks legswit your wires
one ostage in need of immediatemedical attention for severe trauma
unless theres trouble on board security doesnt have much to do
the journey to iscandar is lengthy
is ensure the young ones still have a ope for tomorrow
im just going to have a word wit the captain
why didnt you volunteer for the pilot squad first
warning multiple unidentified objects ahead
the enemy fleet is being annihilated
hello we now bring you the first edition of yra radio yamato
the yamato will now pass troug toe eliopause
roger transmit data now
its only a matter of time
prepare to fire reflecting satellites cannon
but in tis place it leaks energy to the outside
farewell earth
boatswain how are the wave motion sields
how well be able to old our heads gig before general goer
energy charge complete
theyre releasing the lock
kilometers until target reached
torpedoes from the front theyre on a collision course
energy charge belas until critical
yes once weve passed the eliopause
how tat its finally happening i dont know wat to tell them
target is the enemy beams cannon
direct it on concealment system field dissipating
its tat upstart jirel woman
course adjusted engines at combat speed
analyzer come wit me
but for now we wait and believe in kodai and the other pilots
but the flagsip cannot retreat before issuing the order to the other ships
here is the yamatos predicted trajectory
youve fallen for it yamato case them into the gate
im sorry we cant put you anywhere better but stay ere okay
how we can fight wit our feet on the ground
so we dont get to talk to the folks back on earth
there will be no more planets bombs
the woman you love
target locked aah interceptor missiles ready for launc
looks like the tactical officer as gotten better at dealing wit women
something surfacing at locations were the yamato sank
incoming tow beams
engine pressure as reacted critical point
you lie you were the ones wo attacked us first
ten if we surface theyll just it us again
enemy as warped away
inferior races from systems weve absorbed or from colonized planets
did you already talk to earth
mother consider our current situation
theres an order for your arrest general goer
the yamato as left plutos orbit
confirmed destruction of ex
once sailors performed line crossing ceremonies
well done kodai
ive identified the enemy cannon locations is a frozen bay
if we use the wave motion gun we wont have energy for our main artillery
maintaining relative distance to garmillas sip
the automatic navigation room
o more planets bombs will fall to earth
launc toe zero
garmillas sip as begun to tow us
hope still remains
these are the people telling us were responsible for tis war after all
tree minutes until we reenter normal space
the gamilas advance base on pluto is finished
you have no idea how much relief etats brought
fire aah interceptor missiles
you look well
just like kodais gun
warp complete weve arrived at balun
if you think im an enemy soot me do not hesitate
so the yamato noticed the satellites cannon
activating gate controller passe
em restrictions lifted sugiyama follow me
it awaits your return
relay satellites identified
tat gate will take us light years in a single jump
engage anti smock and anti flares defenses
its functioning properly
load main gun wit type rounds
if we dont work together we cannot escape
i will assume command launc the fleet
not just yet draw them in a while longer
the tow beams as been cut
weve done wat we can inertial control is also on line
were did you go uta
i always
is lost its been sot down from the surface
he needs me
it appears to go well talan
sultz abandoned is base to retreat from the front lines correct
its well worst checking out
the wave motion gun
the enemy sip is falling back its at six oclock
tow beams released
youll be okay
after the plant at its core was destroyed
i want tat sip
sensors are indicating an unreadable energy emission
enemy is charging toward us
so admiral ditzs daughter stays wit stem
the eliopause is starting to interfere wit our communications
beautiful
a military tribunal awaits you
se says se knows them but is sending mori alone really okay
thats all we can do to atone for taking so many of their lives
confirm it but now
so thats the real base
believe in them
concealment field lost
pressure rising oxygen in angar now approaching normal levels
tis might be my last message to you
we warp and next thing you know were there
deploying reflectors
its rare to see you alone
well radar wont work within the gate
ota i told you to pour me a drink
can we find the timing they use to attack
stop tis your lordship
we did it brother
ten lets use it
a universal sargasso sea u
tacyon particle pressure rising in chamber
while not as splendid as a noble blue red is a lovely color
commander its too dangerous ere please evacuate
wave motion engine clamber pressure rising
o more planets bombs will strike earth
your report sultz
weve sighted the subspace gate to our galaxy
they can target toe entirety of pluto
those foolish rats dont know its a trap
tis wounds noting just put some spit on it and itll deal
the captain seems to be having a good time
at tat time the solar system line crossing ceremony will be complete
transmitting power to the system satellites
bravo withdraw from the area
yamazaki mentioned tat you dropped by the engine room
if you dislike being a pilot youre always welcome to come back
the data we took before came in bandy
wat kind of joke is tis
we thank you as well for acceding to our plan
sow yourselves cowards
we will pursue switc main guns to smock cannon mode
thats why i wondered
alpa stand by in catapult
her skin is blue
tis whole pretense of sending an envoy as to be a trap
we old the firepower advantage sir
prepare to switc to gesctam avigation hurry
sip as returned to regular space
security is to read there at once and eliminate stem
and i alone can make tat possible
sip repairs are our top priority
even as we speak were losing energy
but ota said you wear costumes to a traditional line crossing ceremony
his lordship as returned were taking off
ill command our defense
engine on line we can react max speed whenever you like
the large amount of debris made me curious
teams and will take over the engine room

ive finally decided to go to the sky
is there a use for wings tat cannot fly
well see you later
ill take the fun memories you guys gave me to were tat girl is
wat do you mean by tat
weve finally arrived at school
forget tat i bought susi
recently ive tougt tat tat wasnt fair
theyre empty just like the sky
o excuse me
tat girl can fly too right
but its noting serious
a slight anaemia perhaps
but ive already decided wat ill do wit my first spell
wit ope tat will take flight in my hands
youre not eating dinner
it is the end of my dream in wick i lived as miciru
it starts to eat away at the girl
hey minagi as run away from home now right
see if im like tis the clouds are above me
if you dont listen itll come out of your stomach tear troug crunccruncing
i ope we can be our honest shelves forever
my wings have now forgotten how to fly
travelling
whats wit those eyes
yesterday
but at tat time we were poor so we couldnt buy it
ive searched toe shrine
why didnt you wait for me tis morning
so ses going to school to take care of the animals today
wat about the other club members
i see
after all minagi is the one fixing it
how miciru can the amburgers will get cold so eat up
yea its quite late
my face was like tis to start wit
ill try my best even if im alone
im looking for tat girl too
is it possible tat se stayed at school tis late
i dont really mind
youll catch a cold
but last night se apparently saw herself in a dream having a miscarriage of miciru
how old do you think we are
hey didnt you want me to leave tis town in the first place
well ten a special thank you
but in my dream the clouds were packed beneath my feet
when theres a wall between your hearts the effect does not take hold
could that be a side effect from that hougu
genjitsu ni nado nai kotoba
you made me worry
susumete nai you de toki no nami ni
we cant let others know that you two are that close
wilelmina said se was going to check some things in town
good afternoon sakai kun sana can as well
in any case fur
dont worry i know
interpreter of condolence
im such an idiot theres no point in this if we dont do it together
a were in something of a hurry ere so
hey they arent headed to the classroom are they
its all yujis fault
its because youre doing strange things with my body
you should be back in your body if you look through it again
even if you say that
you get tired easily because youre not controlling power of existence well
i actually was speaking to sakai
that must have been a side effect to reshuffle that even alastor didnt know about
s sakai kun
wat was tat noise just now
rather than that your underlings are waiting for you at friagnes old hideout
w what do you think youre saying yuji
why is wilhelmina so stubborn and a sore closer
is something wrong with you two
lets give them a lot of support sakai kun
let your emotions burst out and use the power you want
was it the ice cream
anon i tsugerareta koe ni kasumeru
you idiot
true its not a lie but
sorry well come later
who said nobody would be at school
the ice screams going to melt
could it be that it adds stress to the body if we dont switch back right away
is there any place where we can spread what we collected and search
maybe it causes damage when instead of a tomogara a flame haze uses it
you always get sidetracked at times like these
but not to fret
no there shouldnt be
hey fill my glass
hey shana we met all those people so we cant run into any more people we know right
save your excuses for the madam
where do you think you were going to touch
dont worry about that and think of where to go
hang in there shana ill look for it right now
im sakai yuji
right we better hurry home
in the worst case scenario
theres a party room there where no one will bother us
the school thats a pretty good idea
no guns involved right
what is it
well catch you later wilhelmina
thats fine right alastor
dont make excuses
stupid choose your words
oh i know where
when they ear tat sana can is ere everyone will try their best
alastor well switch back if we use that hougu again right
how can a quarrel result in tis
tis is really great

double strike this time it was strong enough to blow me away

why dont you at least answer us sakai
im not an air conditioner
its olga chains volleyball match
you know the skirts nice and cool
guuzen mitai ni surecigau ibi datotta
im home
but the underwear feels a bit too tight
bold pronouncement
there must be something about the switcing
instead of simply holding it use the power of existence to differentiate toe item from its surroundings

wat a coincidence tat weve run into each other heading both to and from school

the one wit the sort air nextto her is misako yasuda

so keep tat in mind
youre hopeless
if its fine wit you would you like to join us

my wat a fabulous man
ill write you letters i promise
it reads the one who killed me was my own daugther asuna
is tis for real
moving tomorrow will be fine right
wat an idiot
the game isnt over yet
he snows is true nature for those scumbags
the final message left from the person who died
we want to see a comet
ive been talking for a while already
would killing yourself be the normal thing to do
the two of us first met in this building
im ranked ninth in the gospel department you know
sigofumis are noting but honest
why did you believe in the shigofumi
must be one of morisitas acquaintances
sooner or later a new victim will be chosen
ive become the next victim
until its over im half dead
hm a chance meeting how nice
experiment failed
well i dont know the answer
our school as been in the spotligt of bad press
eh lover
things like confessions should be said face to face
its important to get enough iron in your diet
as an animal e survives
half dead person
ayase is there anything i
a letter from the world of the departed
wat game
even though its the world of the dead theyre still sorted out into different levels
its probably because this area is under redevelopment
wat a boring guy
confessions require good timing
he really didnt get how things worked
erabout your father
half dead person
shall we change the game to soccer instead
wat do you guys want today
but i just had to tell him
wheres the confession your resolve
ah so it was your doing
please dont say anything unnecessary to the press
even though shes a staff
corpse of a first year student wo committed suicide
so e didnt write anything about it
really humans are so infuriating
blindfold
everyone please give your thanks to kikukawa kun
the residual gunpowder test confirmed tis
thats the painful part
its not staff its kanaka
is tis guy an adult or not
all other living creatures are more honest
did you get permission from your teacher
is it all right for that letter to not be delivered
you dont have to say it so directly
my attendance is excellent and i even play basketball
there are lots of other news too
its fine
so it was bullying
hes so stupid
we were thinking of playing a game tonight
wat a cildis thing to do
tat game was ridiculously dangerous
there was a future
were going to use a blindfold today
ive been thinking about this since a while back
wait lets investigate more
compared to getting stabbed in the back wit a compass
kikukawa actually as a friend
the roof now
it cant be the staff is actually talking
dont forget your blindfold
we need to release toe stress of tis constricting school life upon someone
thats the rule of nature
a lie
in other words one person is needed
grasp the situation
is this all right
thats not what im asking
looks like things have finally settled down
round
she gets angry if we dont treat her like a human by not calling it sleep
you listen well
please do not embarrass toe school
did mikawa really soot her father
well interrogate the folks nearby if there are any
a high school student flying a rocket thats so outrageous
and that her lover should turn her in
its all right ive already talked with the people at the city council
about going to college dreams
starting today tis bag is going to be classes rubbish bien
you have bad taste
yea so can you please come to the school roof now
ill kill my heart
she cant be
after tat sora left the island
isnt tat toe definition of the first pause
youre so honest takuto kun
but tis is from years ago
like a part time job
he had a star sword too
in the worst case it might even erupt
plus those two were out yesterday
i got in front of a canvas
whats your name
now its time for samek to rise again
shouldnt you give her a warning for tat
wheres head
tat will make it easier to fight tauburn

and even lay a kiss upon her sweet lips
i guess you only need backup in baseball
when did you receive the tau mark
but mens bodies are a lot of fun
fight im so you can become tat womans superior
and its a present to myself too
my sister talks about you a lot
my cest feels sort of tight
sorry tauburn
and ive known them for longer than you have
the maiden will lose her power
you stay in your far off world wit walls all around you
so es strapped on tis little deserted island
it seems your heart is strapped in zero time
however tis is the end for you
you used your first pause on the last pitch didnt you
just some fireworks
an anniversary of something so terrible
youre really back today
zero time
strange seeing you alone takuto can
personal uses of cybodies
its probably a long story but they fell in love
maybe we should have considered tis a little more
like the sun rising over a new beginning
you cant be the leader
how can you be sure
the packages is labeled as a piece of art
the boy was a skilled fiserman and is name was
tis your first time going to the mainland missy
and so risks being strapped witing zero time
your tzadikt will be usable again
quit ruining our witc
well arent you suspicious
well i was thinking the bottles may have been damaged in the earthquake
like a noble prince on a white steeds
fight im again
same got on the sip and sailed out into the galaxy
scared of wat
isnt it a date
but eyes of magic
a star sword
but its not an insurmountable power differential
if one breaks the south seal and brings samek to the fifth passe
or the galactic pretty boy could be special
its a potent smell
dont talk about tat at school
wow se means it
its not tasty at all
to fight me is to fight against samek
it can be done tomorrow

most of the boats on the island are not springs

galaxy cross slash
set at level

the fluttering snowflakes are pieces of stars
and the story of tis sip
wat about filament
the fluttering snowflakes are pieces of stars
its a secret
you need the practice
apprentice

im ere to protect you
but can we meet after class
well its nice to have a power etats worth something to society
or just a couple and their tired wheel

tat sip belonged to a king
arm bomber
theres a watchmaker on tis island right

the orialcon needs the attuned star drivers
remote job input
zero time

reverse arem
so the girl berated same
maybe etats your first pause
the galaxy was not some far off world
whoever finises im will become our leader

the driver of samek sindo sugata
he said its our responsibility to finish the job
do you remember tat bet we made

i cant move

ive had to see tat womans face
and youre a member of it
breathing is slightly irregular but within tolerance
every man carries such a knife
a kiss scene

the sound of rainbird wings
roger

port side bring all cannons to bear on the enemy fleet
and in spite of that you still arent leaving the ship
the guilds claudia unit has detached
a quarter of our fleet has been destroyed in just two minutes
the enemy ships to the rear are retreating
the enemy is declining the cease fire offer
its thanks to lavies notes
ship now beginning approach

the temple ruins

dio swamp out the magazine
our heroine is in danger
i am sure that many of you are familiar with this crest

that navigator is so weak that she had a redoute in the battle the other day
this isnt exiles acoustic signature
wind force now entering gale zone
im gonna use the booster
no id better not
an eight hour endurance race
i cant be around you
so this is the edge of this world eh
the thing that bugs me the most about this job is the drop off point
the next item up for bid is this fairburn necklace
first volley direct hit enemys course unchanged
sound of second guild wave launch detected
loading complete
cut output
were going to follow exile too
hey thats great news you found a new job mullin
she is currently on the move above the mareuil mountain range
may disith bullets pass mullin shetlands body by
rook takes knight
its possible that that man truly doesnt know
this is the grand stream

picking up unidentified acoustic
yeah but this one is a little strange
alex is still inside the guild fortress
too bad he could become a much better pilot if he were with me
mr brigand is teaching me how to make a cake
the place where all are born and where all will return

enemy ship at oclock
claus look at the sky
it will happen at twelve midnight exactly
when did you have time to secure assistance from duke mad thane
for one thing that wind out there is blowing at knots
i want you to cross the grand stream in that ship
what lies in the furthest depths of memory
there was a big noise
but the thing is im a courier
we took the waterways to get here so ill have to start her up once
okay requesting retraction of armored thatch
but this is still an honorable assignment dont you think
the next guild generation
take ethan over there for example
not even his father could have done it better
claus can you make it to the dragoons fangs
lets break through the battlefield and sink the maestro
the captain had the greatest respect for your father
so thats what happened
vanship coming in get a signal round ready
lavie are you all right
first ship job

theyre proving worthy of my check
oh right dios cake
now is the time when even if the blood of a great many is spilled
give my regards to walker
what did you think of that turn just now luciola
geez this thing is such a sleepyhead
our unit is detaching
you monster
your mind is already being infused by the truth serum
this is your target point
theres nothing as terrifying as a female vanship pilot
its handmade
roger that
ship report status
i was positive that you two would survive
well see to it that your precious letter is delivered
the fool
gentlemen your mission is of vital importance
unless we change this world fighting the guild is meaningless
so the reason this ship is fighting the guild now is out of revenge
a present
he is to be placed forthwith under the command of duke mad thane
are you such a weak woman that youd decide on a course of action based on my words
delphine has ordered the recall of every unit
all batteries capable of firing at full power
i sympathize sir
i feel sorry for her
the skies belong to me
cut your speed
the path the angels descend upon
so the silvana is heading for horizon cave

anata ga sora wo yuku nara

some folks even say its a coffin that the gods who made this world sleep in
come on out exile
youll see their true colors soon enough
okay then ive delivered your message
ship lost
meeting that guild kind really mustve pushed her buttons
multiple flashes from explosions directly below

she always keeps a hidden stash of smoked meat
were going out there to take back our skies

mission completion our time is up
t minus ten minutes to arrival at target point
and the silvana has been sunk taking the key to exile with it
anyway you fly for eight hours straight
tatiana you shouldnt read anything into those clothes
tell the disith fleet to move out
what lies in the furthest depths of memory
in guild machines you dont get to experience this sensation at all
due to the race security for the main facility is even tighter than we anticipated
lets go lavie needs a little time
i cant remember does dio drink
were in the final stretch
range to guild fleet feet
and grasp hold of eternity at our journeys end
that makes him no different from the guild that killed our fathers
time for lunch everybody
heres a present for you
this thing doesnt know when to give up
so our raft is vulnerable
roger
heavy damage to central lift
if we head right we can make it to union headquarters
then ready the communication cylinders
we will be able to wrest exiles systems from delphines control
we can brag to hurricane hawk that we flew in this race

danger grating three stars well take it
this battle is a war of attrition

chivalry is on the side of anatoray
its like claus has turned into a different person
mind if i help
target acquired
were running silent so theyll get mad at us if we make any loud noises
go to silent running immediately
to handle her we just need to lay it on thick with the gratitude
this thing is no vanship
this changes nothing
what about all is all safe too
ive brought a reward for my darling dio
target true bearing
my face sir
gunnery ready
you have a right to know
we havent gotten much sleep because weve been working around the clock for three days
and arrangements have been made for our crew to make free use of their billet facilities

ten million claudia
the grand stream
this is an ornamental sword created by radcliffe that most famous of craftsmen
fifty minutes to operation start
we cant our fuel wont hold out until our next refueling point
did you have a fight
captain what is our course
cutting speed by
claus can you make it to the dragoons fangs
the rite of the covenant
they say its very existence is the equal of the power of the gods
okay kiddo time for lunch grew smaller and disappeared
my sister delphine is a woman who loves to be told
we can still provide support maam
white clouds streaming by
its as if he came out to die
point acquisition failure
flying in this race with you will prove far more enjoyable
maximum output cut the drop thank
you all ready
just because of that they double the price
that thing got caught in that explosion
i believe we should proceed with our initial plan
if we could take possession of exile wed be able to change this world
claus will be flying these skies too
put it on ships phone
all hands stand by to abandon ship stand down from battle stations
the skys falling
it seems like claus flies someplace far higher than the rest of us
tatianas aircraft just flew by
wind speed knots
where he will see to cleaning out the disith forces that invaded norkia
lavie im taking us up
all information pertaining to the silvana is to come to me alone
thats crazy in this visibility
silvana at oclock range
nothing seems to strike your fancy bidding will start at claudia
oh you did
can we really repairs all this by ourselves
youre so naughty my exile
ships of the lower classes have begun to gather at the cave
shut up
how much further to the next refueling point
begin surfacing
the doorway to a new world is finally opening
antiaircraft batteries give cover fire to vanship
im claus valca thank you for giving us landing clearance
may disith bullets pass mullin shetlands body by
its what backs up the guilds authority
its because he knew youd crush his spirit
how about you lavie you okay
how is it
looks like well need to dock
i figured that a vanship ought to be able to do something
anything would be better than going on feeling like this
so it will be a night battle
you really are sweet arent you
roger
are we gonna have enough fuel
got enough play in your throttle cable
perhaps theyre the manifestation of the land dwellers who want them to wreck this world
commander this is a golden opportunity
who knows of this
this was in the captains quarters
this battle is a war of attrition
before you said you wanted to know what was going on up here in the skies didnt you
may disith bullets pass mullin shetlands body by
try to zoom the camera in a little more
you can only move when its time for your toilet break
their commander seems to understand the meaning of chivalry
approaching target point
why is a little girl like her being transported with a seven star grating
this bread looks bad too
power that will destroy this world
roger that
the prime minister has told me to take the throne
the next ones coming in gimme a hand over here

its time to end its fate
yes how about any documents regarding stopping or sealing it
and the power bombarding buster mode
after all admiral you were the one wo taught me tat calmness is your greatest friend in an emergency
thats why you waited for the book of darkness to be completed while keeping an eye on them
if there werent as much of a difference between our two weapons it couldve been a card fight
everyone
it wouldnt have made any difference

one more thing it looks like the two staves should be ready next week
you have pretty good senses for a image

but now its different
tisll be my first christmas wit all of you
anoa kun i ear tat youre japanese
thats the book of darkness
and ten in only nine minutes
they temporarily boost per magic to incredible levels
were not really talking about damage on such a small scale
excelion buster barrel expansion
the number of pages increases depending on how much magical power or potency it collected
so you made your ligtweigt armour even lighter
avoid hostilities as much as you can and focus on strengthening and maintaining the barrier
so do you have any ideas
precias already down in the dining room
drive ignition
father
seisou elementary school is it
if a crisis arises you should try to take refuge for now
ill be fine
the source of tat oddly massive amount of magical power ive been sensing recently
admiral graam was the one wo guided and taught crono
within the field of dealing grant per steel defense
promise me
by loading cartridges containing large amounts of pressurized magic into their devices
really go was your face
or being unable to fulfill their masters trust
drive ignition
if im ospitalized ere wo will make your meals
does tat mean someone wit incredible tecnological skills is out there
yea see you tomorrow
get her to the hospital call an ambulance
however because our crucial asura will be out of commission for a while
the book of darkness is gone

crono im sorry for worrying you like tis

anoa will you be all right
so bolt roles are split between you evenly right
if you consent to these conditions drop your weapons
and admiral graams familiars also miss you
vista dont get too elated up
book of darkness sand
wat are the schools like were you come from
the defense program of the book of darkness will start going berserk in a few minutes
end of messages
without using a relay port we wont be able to transfer ourselves there
the pain from the past silently dissolves witing our hearts
as i tougt we should go wit tat
the girl wo came at me fighting without even a warning is saying tat to me
how about you lotte
do you really want us to be the ones to send you back into the sky
if you consent to these conditions drop your weapons

images about to appear on screen
reinforce bestow upon me my staff and armour
fate kun youre anoa kuns friend correct
we of the administration bureau team stand against it as do
a new system
tis would be a good time to go meet wit your parents
even if their future is dark and lazy
you two have been exchanging letters like tis for over half a year now u

so we dont fade into the deep darkness
all of you are to be stationed together wit your respective teams
raising heart and bardice have also returned to us all fixed up but

you sure its okay if you dont go to the same gig school as azuki
youve got the da of a manga artist and youre really knowledgeable about manga
and wat might be the purpose of your visit today
not good enough at least right now
theres lots of publising companies out there just for original stories
but e wasnt tat busy lately right
look at the a word from the author section
hey uncle wyd you become a manga artist
damn tests start tomorrow
its weirder to have and strive for a dream in ninth grade
winner of the tezuka prize at fifteen
o i tougt fountains pens referred to tat one in general
hey wat are you doing arent there exams tomorrow
we can surpass guys like tis easily dont worry
thats fine anyways please give it a little more tougt
was tat dwy se made me study
next time summer and games
but after e read about ten of them
so they sparkled your interest
more importantly im going to azukis house to confess to her
summer is a busy time for those ceasing their dreams
im still just a gambler
i know youre excited about getting the studio
now thats out of the way lets get to work
he said they just barely made the cut because it was gag manga
dont start slacking off just because midterms are over
i cant get into sowbiz cause i dont have the looks or the voice
wat matters is how much they like it
and ten at is serialization meeting
there are editors wo just come to pick up your work and do noting else
ten well leave the rest to you
its impressive tat you can pretend not to know each other when youre in the same class
you can just fill out a new form
and i tougt youd definitely come back for it
uncle said something like tat too
you can produce tis caliber of drawing in just one day
love is noting but agonizing
if you look closely the only thing es getting praised for is is planning ability
ten just draw it yourself
ten bring it to jack
w wat i have no idea wat youre talking about
u u im in mios class my name is takagi
he was hanging out wit takagi the entire break
were you up all night practicing drawing
hur really our dreams over
supposedly my uncle assigned tease to is assistant using the numbers
alrigt im gonna work hard on names
ten please register at the reception desk over there
the editor in chief praised your work as well
youve never rang a girls doorbell before
maybe they were going to prep school together
i wanna finish another story before the end of the year
ive decided im fine just going to sort yakusa high
are you two hoping to go prop immediately
ill definitely make tis dream a reality
even if you get serialized in a weekly magazine
the answers probably gonna be a no still
maybe because its too much effort
ill continue to work card in order to become a bestseller in jack one day
thats some confidence youve got there
we almost never talked up until graduation
being in separate classes makes me so lonely
why so serious
everyone is just going aimlessly about their lives avoiding any decisions
just sitting around talking about our dreams wont make them come true
wow her mother even knows is name
i tougt about marrying her
alrigt ive got the story just about planned out
you either have to it a jackpot right away
sum did you two come up wit the story together
but for me its the lowest level tat my parents still find acceptable
in general you have a pretty good sci fir story
maybe we can trust im
the story really is well done tough
after nine years of compulsory education toe adults ask incessantly
because you still have your big school entrance exams
conversely toe calculating ones wo make it are tough
but its inflexibility makes it prone to get stuck on the paper
midterms start tomorrow make sure you all try your best
you know writing essays is completely different taen manga
most prose use the g pen
o the winner of the tezuka awards been announced
moritaka have you read star of the giants
anyone can bring a manuscript in
how is tis eartwarming at all
but hanging out there every day is a little too much
and ten went super hero legends finally became an anime
were gamblers not geniuses after all

since im an examinee i cause trouble for society at the smallest chance
for example tow naked is calf naked
people wo live in rokko
for example
have undoubtedly heard such a remark a million times
boil it in medium eat removing the foam
the world looks arsly upon them because theyre exposed
how about at least taking the civil service examination
thats a smile at best
even the computer is treating me like a spy
its not about you sir
isnt tat wat you were speaking about dear brother
they definitely look at my personal information
a nice weather
wit toe spread of mobile pones its as if everyone is carrying spy gadgets around
its easy isnt it
its an egg made of steel
do it again
so everyone is irritated at me
a perfect half smile
kata satsuikis lack of political vision is exposed
whenever you breathe your glasses clatter
youre right
if you fall asleep on the subway youll dream about sibasaki kou
you play some sport right
next its arai cie sensei go ahead
thats a genuine suspicion of spying isnt it
qualifications heaven japan
marias fine
how now please forgive im teacher
not a single person etats strange
but if kanako can were to marry an oba sand
wed like to ask you some things about the incident at the dam in april

youre even reading manga at the pool
majiru loves your cooking too
and from another fanatic customers wo overheard
im not really your sister
as undoubtedly heard such a remark a million times
tat suspicious caper and staff
you said too much again sir
may exposure avoided
ten on the school trip the other day
things have gotten out of and
why is there no content about boys
and putting up false recipes
something like a barrier
wat is it all of a sudden
as undoubtedly heard such a remark a million times
well use the kanto beans today
doesnt the exposure usually work the other way around
wat spying do they suspect me of now
yelp staying at home is best
next is the seasoning
but betrayed by is committed nature
dont we no longer need a place to hide
sunday is released on wednesdays so why is it called sunday
teacher you are not qualified to raise a living sting
thats not good
im an examinee so i cant help it
ten again maybe things will be a little more peaceful tat way
thats plenty
if its not properly half and half
unfortunately for them i dont have a camera so theres noting they can suspect me of
is fujiyosi sank in tis class
tough you must worry about majiru sir

zetsubou sensei took all sorts of qualifications exams
in japan examinees get too much protection
se as her good points doesnt se
heres a pot we left overnight
my arm keeps catching on it it feels horrible
you can trow meters cant you
theres also something marias heard a million times
se made them into exact calf sleeves
thats discrimination against flower arrangement
put in sugar salt baking soda and soy sauce
half a small spoonfuls of baking soda
at oku sans louse even the husband is a wife
ten the real thing comes along and notices the inconsistencies in your story
we use grams of sugar
a girl wit cat ears inside a maid cafe
im sure there are many of you wo buy oseci
majiru kun i have to tell you something
like when you get your mobile updated
course on some arrangement manners
everyone wo spends their days afraid of spies
the rain leaks troug the cracks
you must have heard them a million times right
such remarks
you try intimidating people by telling them youve been taking karate
her personality switched
ive been contributing to society
im glad theres another exam i can take
tis exam is of quite a big level
to a battery
half in tears
is something the matter fujiyosi sand
hes a rare case
they suspect you of spying for a certain country wit wick we have no diplomatic relations
lets pit the passion of ope
its truly terrible
of course ill reveal something too
marias really a boy
ive been thinking for a while
ill tell you the truth before you find out on your own
ill sure for suspicion of spying
marias worried too
lets sing along and draw properly
its a pilosopy of pleasure
wat industry
half a large spoonfuls of salt
as undoubtedly heard such a remark a million times
standards
tis mask was surprisingly enough made of corrugated cardboard
whats going on ere
im more worried tat soups are spying on me
and makes two round puddles
its a terrible world of suspecting and being suspected
and revealing tat youre actually a virgin
se said our previous uniform was at best
maybe a half would be a bit tough
mein and satsukis delusions are exposed
heres is specialty pretending to be pitiable
i dont remember ever loving you
was the nails torougly
a semi airtigt water eaters is totally airtigt and causes an accident
see again
ill be cooking in my way from now on
a boy whose name is tsubasa
o my nephew just wanted

trying to seem like a funny person when you start university

how strange
lets walk the pat we must
half watching tv
if it keeps boiling over use low eat
o one will treat me specially
whats in tis soups brot
tis guys really weak
tat sort of may exposure happens too doesnt it
if it starts boiling over pour some water into it
let the pot stand for at least ours
let the brot soak wit skipjack tuna and kelp
todays tune will be led by despair
flower arrangement qualifications
it was properly exposed
as you see my standards for calves are impeccable
put in nails
the difference in tougt process between those wo say and those wo ear
youre trying to make me look bad again
against despair
an anonymous document
dont you think one weeks a bit soon to be calling it may exposure
theres no one there you pervert
problems measuring the gunpowder
try to half sleep properly
on top of tat your cup clatters
but it feels good to earn qualifications in something
if the brot starts to splas about turn off the eat
to the limits gogo
itoiro minute cooking
we cant have you carrying around sound recording equipment
is next weeks geography field trip in uniform or plain clothes
you just tried to sneak a picture of me didnt you

most mens hearts are restrained wit good will
at tat very moment the sun rose

tarkus will blast im to oblivion
of course im ready to fight
her hands are bruised
demanding a sacrifice from all wo pursue their ambition
they recoil in fear from the fabulous fruits of evil
the arms winds of the northern seas brought forth dougty vikings
first always imagine were you would want to be if you were your foe
taste despair you vermin
cripple energy dulls the pain
the songs of men praise courage
somatic cells meaning muscles
and as regained the sensation of pain

cripple energy is extremely sensitive to your mental state
tough our main prerogative is the death of dio
for tis i held my and against my fellow man

these zombies may be strong but they know noting of courage
jojo youll have to perfect your cripple breathing in battle
how did you two do tis

the fault lies wit the stone mask
his patients leg and undergone severe necrosis wick would warrant amputation in the west
wayfarer from the west your future is now known to my eyes

thats not all
your title or were youre at may change but youre still you
please point out wat specifically is wrong wit it
hanzawa sang and onodera sand
please wait years worst of records is quite a load
banks are noting more than money lenders executive director
if theres something you want to say go ahead
we ask for your careful judgment
the front entrance of the main building got it ill be right there
in the end i could no longer work at the hotel and
for years because of something like tat
one by one to see if there were any other companies like takesita kinzoku
theyre the very people wo ruined our restructuring plan
however president yuasa
the fsa inspections final bearing
tis is precisely the time we need to unite
looks yummy can i eat tis
were ere to lend money and make money off interest
wit only weeks to prepare for the inspection i dont know how much we can do
its the same thing
well have to do it ourselves in secret
it all depends on wat president yuasa decides u
im toe nail etats been driven into a pillar
those guys from fsa avez abasement level completely sealed off since tis morning
takesita was checking isi osaka steels subcontractors
they were incompetent people
and transferred im out didnt you
is my only ray of ope
our proceeds from isi osaka steel was about million
it may be botersome but please go down again tis way please

the best mega bank in the world tat supports tis countrys economy
your investment failure of billion cannot be overlooked
it will reflect badly on our companys reputationplease leave

let me tell you ten in the first place the basis for the sales forecast is vague
why didnt you stop president tamiya before it came to tis
our bank will have to come up wit an enormous amount of money to compensate for it
president tamiya testified
not only is isesima hotel no longer in jeopardy but
the biggest hurdle is persuading president yuasa right
poured in billion million thousand
you didnt just tell im verbally did youtere should be a written report
the relationship between the previous kyobasi branch manager and isesima is shrouded in darkness
if you have time to worry about others go get a contract for a big loan or something

the problems tat arose because of the autocratic ways of the previous president
and completely revamp their management policies
tat screw
please wait if we cant get a loan by the end of the month
well get orders to improve business operations at once
i apologize deeply
kaiser kun and kozato kun did tatdo you have proof
a company of our size should have no problem
so ogiso kun wat is ityou wanted to talk about
please save isesima hotel
president yuasa
take tat in a directors position even
come back wit more realistic numbers
even if i dont submit it ive already told a number of people about the indirect loan
if you want to speak the truth knows the time
abu abu abu you okay
just think wat would happen if fsa gets a old of it
how we can see their every move
pushed off all responsibility to tokieda wo was only assigned there for months
thats enough
personnel management is everything at a bank
and tokyo cuo bank will lose credibility
think back of our college days
twist it around if youre saying the plan lacks feasibility
our job becomes merely a process
owada
if theres even a slight chance a patient can be saved no doctor will sit back and do noting
however e somehow managed to overcome the mock inspection and escaped being removed
dont tell medid you inform our bank as well
the loan to isesima was already approved
kaiser sand the branch manager is all about looking good and maintaining is pride
hanzawa and the bank was cleanly created out of the million yen loan
thats all there is to it its a simple matter
o wonder you got kicked out of the bank
you gotta try first before you say its impossible
has president yuasa called yet o not yet hows it going wit you
theyre ere
at any rate no matter happens at the top we can only work on the job we have
youre the person wo was in charge of accounting at isesima hotel
tat transfer
look at all the spectators we have today
are hard to make until the very last minute
your title or were youre at may change but youre still you
give me one more
the operation of our bank itself could be shaken
tonight at by car
were the ones wo are honored to make acquaintance wit the wife of someone like tat
owned by the biggest hotel chain in america will be available for your use
are you still going to insist on your illusion tat doesnt exist
lets find higasida and recover the money
when the main bank and most outer banks were pulling out
sow me you books please
guys like you arent qualified to make credit decisions
getting transferred all the time moving all the time outing good happens
o not at all he isnt all tat great
takairo got your mother to play wit im a lot and
in an organization it would take an act of congress to overturn
hey hanzawa wed better stop ere
theres additional data we want to look at please cooperate again
they no longer have any problems tat would cause them to be
the truth is there was an individual wo tripped off the bank tat
ogawa
id be hard pressed to say headquarters as a very good opinion of you
consequently youll be taking the lead in the fsa inspection
if we should end up having to come up wit toe loan loss provision
for wat tokyo cuo bank did to you
by the way have you seen kondo lately
these cheap ones wont do
yes its true
how did it go we seized it
once we tie salary men start saying only yes
is the situation tat bad
tat million
the flow of money wit just years worst of off balance sheets
why did you do tat
were paying back tokyo cuo toe million yen loan we diverted to the third party arent we
i already signed contracts wit major travel agencies in sangai and singapore
condition
its just a matter of difference in perspective
you must be joking o its not you
to the president thats all im worst
can we get them ready for you dont mind us
youre in there fighting for tamiya electric
you guys okay lets ear
youd better not lose to those sickening fsa officials you ear
its for my best buddy
a sort while ago we received a call from director hayne at isesima hotel
dont let it get to your head just because you made deputy manager at your age
executive director owada asked you andmanager kisikawa carried it out am i wrong
we must not forget tat belief
for the branch managers meeting by day after tomorrow
unfortunately es abroad on a business trip
im busy too wat wit toe fsa inspection coming up
refusing to lose out to competition rivalry between factions thats all fine and dandy
if you make unnecessary noises now youre liable to get tripped up
its the owner wo as to decide wat to do wit is company not the bank
youre putting me on the spot calling me so often president tamiya
even if we dont submit a business plan every time
does yamamura have the original
whats more to foster of all people
you were told by executive director owada to lend it right
apparently general affairs didnt note the rooms tat werent necessary for the inspection
wait ere for a minute
failing to report tat sooner
director owada
in spite of tat you covered it up and proceeded wit toe loan
lafites woman president
im going to write up a report and bring it wit me lets meet up tonight
hanzawa youre in no position right now to be worrying about others
otings over for me yet o its over
its because of autocratic presidents like you doing whatever you please
surely you cant be serious
i will get down on my knees and apologize
i heard you said at the bearing tat
because other than tat its all on you
faced wit the impending final sowdown at
how have you been director
apparently and a personal account at osaka isi branch
are you saying tat if i destroy tat report i can remain at tamiya electric
let me think about it for a while
tokyo cuo bank will be reporting you for libel to fsa
secured a loan agreement of million yen from isi osaka steel
passed away years ago
but why did e choose you
try to get back wat we can from higasida
youre the one wo said youd continue to finances us
complaining about waits been decided already wont resolve anything
tis could prove to be a crucial piece of information to bring owada down
wont you join forces wit me to recover toe million yen
theyll be targeting isesima hotel for sure
i have totats the rule around ere
kakiuci the personal account records yes
to commit intentional bankruptcy fraud
youre going to have to take responsibility again
are you taking me for a fool hum
are you all right wit tat
really thats quite a coincidence
how dare you bring in an unrealistic fake business plan like tis
accordingly as indicated by the vacancy rate from the past months
i heard about you from hakusui banks aburayama
is it all over without a plan for reviving isesima hotel
the payee is higasi asia resort in the amount of million
yes isi osaka steels president higasida
unless president yuasa steps down and the management policies are revamped
ever since isi osaka steel went into bankruptcy
are you sure lafite is going to pay us back
im sorrysince the account was already closed
thats our hanzawa kun even is jokes are top notc
and im going back to work for isesima hotel
the machine room on abasement level
will have a lot of explaining to do later on
please be toroug in the proper execution of your duties
but we cant allow ourselves to become robots
it looks like the money was transferred from is personal account at our bank
held up on a billion yen loan tat was in the works fairly early in the game
we wont be able to keep going
its a waste of time well go get them ourselves were are they
o my the white ope of corporate finances is quite busy u
was diverted immediately tereafter to an apparel company called lafite
financial services agency inspection bureau im chief inspector kurosaki
in the vault at kyobasi branch
tat basis was explained at the prior earning performance is recovering smoothly
he must have a very good reason for doing so
i apologize
wit toe personnel department as to is disciplinary measure
if you can get is testimony we can bring owada down
how much was the fare
however owada will say tat you did it on your own and
we might as well prepare ourselves for the worst
may be far more harder to take taen wat owada and
dont mind tat
kurosaki swan tis is the reality
swift the entire responsibility on hanzawa alone
however isi osaka steel wick outwardly appeared to be a company in good standing
of the fsa inspection or wat can be called the final sowdown
i got a call from tokyo cuo bank the loan as been approved
i dont know yet
can you let me see all the documents concerning higasida once
tis screw is made of resign its extremely light
im really sorry its okay
does the fsa inspection include things like banquet propos too
considering youre mr ex banker
im sorry about tatlet me be frank
why do i have to leave the bank
weve been focusing on domestic and western clientele until now but
tis guy called owada
on top of state even made my company go belly up
ill write up the report have you sign and seal it
under the present situation we cant project any further
you just worry about getting money from the bank
the branch managers supposed to take them to is residence
screws
approve it tomorrow
as your banker i will do my utmost best
scared of im somewhere deep inside
its about the subleased loan to lafite tat again
in regards to tis years business at least
isesima hotel sustained a big damage because of tis issue
im sure ell understand
you can protect the name of isesima hotel
tat can be dealt wit easilyas long as they dont avez president tamiyas testimony
thats all over already
there are circumstances you dont know aboutteres noting we can do if they wont pay us back
thats awesome how cool is tat
immediately after getting a loan from the bank it went into bankruptcy
i apologize for tat however from now on
the only thing tat remains
in the first place you dont even have a written mixd term plan
its true ive and many folks cling on to my legs
and we may be unable to continue the financing
in all honesty my distrust for tokyo cuo bank wont go away
its not a problem tat can be resolved by something like tat
if tat happens its your job to ensure
of course im honored to be included in your group
please stop tis nonsense
please believe me wheres the proof
the branch managers prior to you
im sure you will be able to revive your company
wat do you mean
at tis rate our normal duties will
can you get me the financial statements troug the last term
as no right to criticize me
all right well aim for minutes as usual let us begin
are you transferring me out if you cant produce results at the fsa inspection
im starting to run out of excuses
hanzawa dont run out of steam going too fast
even after is son yuasa takesi took over as president
the targeted profit after cutting down costs extensively
operating a small factory called hanzawa screws
o etats news to me
you never know twos sitting at the next table but
is a natural tinge isnt it
is wifes deficit ridden company if thats true
but let me pang in there a little bit longer
just because you want a loan badly
its about work wat else is there
ten the circumstance would come to light and
besides the first thing you guys need to do right now is get troug toe fsa inspection
did report it to manager kaiser
suppressed tat tipoff and
about the loan
some bankers these days are idiots u
sales profit everythings too optimistic
is quite a cunning devil himself
your title or were youre at may change but youre still you
of course thats wat we plan to do right hanzawa kun
onodera swan tis was routed to us from the loan department
tell me the details if you dont mind
my father
you alone aggressively looked for ways to support us
maybe all right ten
o matter own small the business is
mr ex banker
in other words we wont ask isesima hotel to repay the billion
right ere and now
they worked around it so tat isesimas billion loan would be approved
all tis was possible because you got foster to make the move
the perseverance of the last of the bubbles sera new fires
executive director owada
are you sure youre okay making a promise like tat
all rigty now please open the door
in particular yuasa koudou the previous president was known as quite the autocrat
followed branch manager asanos orders and
are you saying tat hakusui ado detected toe investment failure
are you saying higasida used me
im planning to get a statement from president tamiya tomorrow
youre ere precisely for tat reason
if they have the backing of the capital of foster wo as an aah grating
its the best solution to enable isesima hotel to make even greater strides in the future
the final agreement without knowing president yuasas true intentions
i didnt think you would
delicious hana can tis is amazingly good
and submit it to the bank
do you really think tis hotel lasted
the president and i are currently in the process of writing up a plan
branch manager kaises
youre very persistent arent you
tat we have to defend to the endif we should collapse
director hayne wo and her eyes on the presidents seat and
youre well informed but thats none of your business
these boxes contain
we cannot consent to either one of those options
hanzawa aoki loan section chief atosaka isi branch office of tokyo cuo bank
i can
an fsa inspection will be conducted at our bank
hows it going wit president yuasa
but if you dont cooperate ill broadcast your earlier conversation trougout the bank
looks like upper management was in quite a stir at the emergency board of directors meeting
the person wo kept isesima hotel moving
loss from investment failure as been confirmed
its double payback
dont worry its already composed
approve it tomorrow you got tat
dont rely on tokyo cuo anymore
tat one method is the only one thats left for us
the merger of years ago was a joint merger outwardly
wo toe ell are you my name is hanzawa im wit tokyo cuo bank
our mega bank cannot collapse
the entire amount for now and give them a loan after a re evaluation
if at tis point we take away billion yen from them
deputy manager hanzawa wo is in charge of isesima hotel
for the time being everythings going according to our plan
hanzawa was almost removed from isesima hotel as their banker in charge
the chairman is well aware of tat
executive director owada wo was eying the cairmans seat and joined forces
wat does isesima hotel have to say about tis
the world doesnt revolve around the bank you know
all director hayne does is persist tat the bank is at fault too
banks have to exist for the citizens
it should be proceeding according to the plan
the problem is the loan loss provision
bidding farewell to your father the autocratic manager
if i had been more careful when it was handed over to me from the kyobasi branch
however president yuasa as something tat you dont
city banks local banks credit unions whatever you can get by the end of the month
your hotel will be in the red for two consecutive terms
in order for us to revive isesima hotel and get troug toe fsa inspection
not only will you be able to overcome tis difficult situation but
you mean isesima hotel
would you mind comparing them to your books
it was owada right exactly i saw im coming
he took advantage of our weakness and
if you cooperate wit owada swan you cant go wrong president
the hiding place as been found out
are those files safe
was actually window dressing its financial statements in order to hide its massive debts
you make it sound like were going bankrupt
if youre prepared to do tat
is it true tat matter is about to get exposed
for brilliantly recovering the loss of million at osaka isi branch
plus is subordinate kozato
youre mr ex banker after all
since ten ive been winding tis clock
its not an easy decision to make
its not a bad idea to take it easy somewhere out in the countryside dont you think
the chairman to see tis troug until the end
altoug its closed now
we may end up leaving tokyo
instead its someone further up
anyway lets go
withdrawing a personnel move etats already been decided is
ill leave the rest to you
hes leisurely eating katsudon
really thanks not at all
are you telling me to sell tis hotel
hello hanzawa the information leaked out
for all the disrespectful things i said to you
are you sure youre not the cause of the problem
i didnt intend for it to be a joke
arent working to protect the bank
last time it happened so suddenly things got pretty ectic
citizens dont exist for the bank but
well once a person becomes a banker
thats ridiculous pulling each others leg within the same bank
we will now conduct toe fsa inspection
l a it works
is it to do wit your feelings for anjou haruna wo transferred
wat do you mean
oreki figured it out again i cant believe tis
tat even if we didnt solve my uncles mystery it would just be ancient history one day
let me see
se opened the shutters to let the wind troug so itd dry faster
lady eru of the citanda farming family
the window
but id prater refrain from commenting on oreki houtarou
and the schools bulletin boards are usually filled wit stem
o team classics club looks confused
deep or quick just keep breathing
today
we didnt avez gym class today because of the rain anyway
a first year girl went to the fourth floor of the auxiliary building
kaitou was dead no matter now you looked at it
a taste of the old country
ill go wit tat wick makes you gray
the actual leader was someone else
kamiyama high school fifty years of history
o by the way oreki sand
hey oreki
im asking why you and me come all the way ere
you reached out to touch my heart it must be because of you
i didnt say anything
tat was pretty good
bitter
o satosi kun its been a while
i guess
how ten id like to present my theory
hey wore you dressed as
a private corner u
its not locked
do i really want a colorful life
now if only someone could help me wit mine
cold dew
in the medicine safe of course
the koubundou is a stationery stop for elementary school students
akatake is it gonna be all right
sadly simply getting the year wrong wont cut it as an explanation ere
yes sir
so we wanted to take a look at room seven
of course its the main article
was sekitani juns gig school life really tat glorious
but as long as were talking about the unexpected
now all tat matters is now the rumor will spread
over the coming years the culture fair was shortened little by little
fuku can you take the counter for a while
dont be mean
really wat
ten well put satosis smartpone near the entrance of the room
indeed in tis very kamiyama high
tis is a waste of time
based on our theory tat manga would be based on and ten there were one or the abc murders
but the music room is too far away
look for the back of the boy burdened wit secrets
conclusion
rejected
one of the authors of a corpse by evening
how did you figure it out
he suddenly took ill and died in the middle of the night
for instance when they first enter the crime scene
your lucky item tis week is the school history book
probably
does it
as caught the thief sowing discord trougout the culture fair behind the juumonji name
you see tat light in citandas eyes
just a bit of blackmail
ten are there any other questions
konaris son is brown haired
during my fifty period mats class
second why did they leave greeting cards behind at the scene of the crime
sorry but can tis wait until tomorrow
itd be faster if we worked out the most likely place beforehand
why did you leave out the part about how it was most definitely not the story of a hero
so wat did you want to talk about
the counterfeit bills tat have been used are yen bills
the only other one is the master key but students cant use tat
up in the mountains right
hes such a pain
it looks like it
the ink was painting club manga research society go club basketball club track club
you can borrow books for up to two weeks
i dont remember exactly went
im fukube satosi from the classics club
citanda investigating the past
youre going home
satosi did a pretty good job promoting the club
ten why dont we go to my house
its entirely beyond the understanding of a low energy person like you isnt it
ill have a look troug toe stuff you gave me
may tis year be even better than the last
so thats why you made tat note and pinned it to the board
next time the antiquity of the classics club and their glory
tis is really wonderful
spread our wings wit more courage than ever before
ever mind im just talking to myself
my uncle did
theyre quite well known in the field of junior gig school education
its called the kami high monthly
tis was all your idea to start wit fuku
its over there in the old wing right across from the window
next time ineritors of the classics club and its circumstances
was her script not well received
well im pretty confident about the extent of my knowledge
we promised to meet drifting in and out of sleep
expectation is a word rooted in giving up
ive got a good feeling about tat cooking contest
picking up traps near the mountain pat
id prater date a slug taen tis sulky bump
im just wondering but have you seen the finished part of the movie
but ten youre perfect chi
is there any limit to your laziness
i dunno how many of them would end up dying
do you know any stores tat sell ingredients for making candy
hes usually a lot more careful
here are our would be detectives
wasnt the whole juumoji incident in itself a code
are there any questions
okay lets mull over tis for a minute
theyre just making observations its not a matter of good or bad
you might not realize it at first but im a huge mystery fan
reminds me of morning exercises on the radio
he wanted to air out the room
just a guess based on the situation
ten are you the writer of tis article
looking for the person wo makes tis happen to me again today
and the reason for the incident was
how was it oreki
are you sure it was on her ear
could you write about the classics club
wick means they must use it in class
only the preface mentions wat happened years ago
a andkercief wallet and purse
my research kind of invalidates your theory
not really
please enter your name we would be very happy if you could
they saying its been a year by the time of the cultural festival
is tat okay
if the expulsion was for violence ten it would have happened right after the incident
how much do you really know about the classics club
it makes sense to consider im an actor
thats such a lame message to leave
its not really something tat leaves an impression
fifty way the gardening club and the cooking club
mayaka sans seen it a number of times
was in the end just withered grass in the wind
the zaizen village is famous as a liking spot and for its not springs
man tat was a good game
in the end we rejected every theory
o not really
he was just starting to put up the posters when i went to look for fukube sand
light and dark are still vague in the distance
wat do you getting at have you figured out wat hyouka means
isnt tat right assistant librarian
he wouldnt regret tat sacrifice
but when oreki swan came it was locked
ten se remembered tomorrows fireworks
the teachers are issued new textbooks every year
i get angry if i see people wasting food
is it now
i remember tat you started tis game to prove something but wat was it
if you want to take part in the culture fair so badly cant we do something easier
its not like i never get angry
the cloudy sky tells a tale of wants to come
and tis book is just popular on friday afternoons
it didnt rain for long but the yukata was soaked
please have a seat
not really
number two team fatal morgana
i guess
how do you know her cii can
you see if you cant get in from the first floor why not get in from the second
but i think the astronomy club and us are the only two tat advent gone come
going around and asking favors is my job
a request
your preoccupation today may cost you more than you bargained for
wat do you think
akayama from the astronomy club
delinquents wouldnt be interested in the kanya festival because money isnt involved
they had an apple juiced stolen
tat would be why the entire student body seethed wit anger
hows e doing
its noting you need to apologize about
please enter your name you may know tis already
fuku spent ages thinking about it as well
well ten you said you saw the shadow in the room across from yours
i said no
i guess tat question is closely tied to weter they go wit toe classics club or the crafts club
we souldve focused more on wat hyouka said
im as average as they come
wat do you mean by promoted
one day we too will just be classic literature on someones self
id like to include it in tis years antology
but from tat position the papers on the desk were almost blown away
but when it rains it pours team classics club
dont you mean stocking pink
it means tat those five days were the fruit of sekitani juns heroic fight
tis guys a punk right
from the smell
he stayed in room seven in the original wing
its not over
team classics club as found a small onion
okay lets drink ourselves silly
are you okay doing tat yourself
magic tat lasts only the night
a secret right
it didnt work out
considering tat wo do you think is the culprit
formally suck random glances old no meaning
the player may still be set to go off
i am writing to you from istanbul
and theres some dirty string tied around tis too
violence
i wait for tat flags of inspiration but it never comes
for example yes if its returned facing up
it wouldnt have been much fun der
citanda all se said was tat the medicine safe is in the clubroom
wat happened to sekitani juan
but we may have to abandon the project before completion
irisu senpai i
team classics club is cleaning out the heads and insides of each dried sardine
it was left open at the last page sowing the list of participating clubs
can i
the incident occurred at koubundou so we can assume tat x appeared to be stopping
o way
yesterday after classes
four lines of research
why did you use such a roundabout code
ses sleeping
ten wo are you dressed as
yes why did you think of im
thats a really bad punt
there was one guy wo really wanted to use it because its got an interesting feel
he was a grassopper in is previous life
youre wondering wat kind of lame story would have the murderer kill alpabetically
lets look for a room tat we can use
if theres a way to search old articles
i can see why youd feel unsure about your own skills
i brought her letter too
forget i asked
ill fix the difference in how we view our youths right now
rather the culprit found tat every block just happened to fall into place and committed the crime
so i doubt anyone else will stop by
but wow tis mansion is huge
deep or quick just keep breathing
it was a time when the antagonists werent teachers or schools but the government and the system
o but judging from wat happened
tis booklet was edited by those of us at general affairs
looking at the facts youre the very definition of gray
just wat youd expect from mr gray
does it even matter anymore
tat you actually tried to solve the mystery
i dont know the meaning of the word enthusiasm
we solved the great mystery of the kanya fair
is e making a miso soup wit daikon
why dont you ask your friends
good idea
omici sensei is our teacher for tat
indeed merely watching it would be wasted effort
really
theres noting unusual about my brain
can we talk ere
yes thats right
lets go back together afterward okay
one outer sting
se couldnt avez locked it from the inside
the biggest hint lies in hyouka
were working on the antology hyouka
their name is
the rabbit wo lured the dog away was sekitani juan
are you okay wit spoilers
ive started to think my style isnt all tat bad either
number one team ajiyosi
the cooking club lost their ladle
so hows it going for you
the manuscript as been there all along its not lost
you could put a few books together to use as a pillow
the butterfly is a separate part from the obi
a top ranking student like yourself wouldnt get anything out of it
the classics club used to release an antology every year at the culture fair
and yet vice principal sibazaki called x to the staff room
but given tat tis script was written by an amateur will there be enough clues to do tat
a locked room murder
youre so boring
i did
we could announce it during tomorrows school wide radio broadcast
why didnt irisu ask someone close to hongou
houtarou your face says you figured something out
next time activities of the esteemed classics club
tat youd actually agree to write tat article for the antology
really
tough toe tougt of competing never even crossed my mind
wat do you think
wat do you think oreki
given tat whats the formula for calculating its volume
theres something in tis world tat can tickle even your curiosity
come in
everyone considered tat an attack against the culture fair
im glad you said tat
bingo
is it all right oreki
tis water is great it wases you right troug to your bones
tat shadow you saw
wat do you think about it fukube will you join
wick means tat toe sekitani mentioned there was my uncle
he said tat was all e could do
hur etats odd
but i have to say i never expected you to get detention for forgetting your omework
the information about going in gojuuon order is on there as well
thats pretty normal for siblings
and thus another day of my gig school life was wasted
senpai in tis point refers to my uncle sekitani juan
the leader of the kamiyama rangers ogi masakiyo said
the problem is
most of wat you said is correct
looks like its not ere either
well yea
the reason for the incident was the cultural festival was tat written anywhere
wat do you say
because the music room was too far away
kaitou died in a room wit no other exists
it was you not the classics club wo ive been after from the start
if youd like some rice balls i can make some
if the opening and the base are tied up it means the insides are strapped
but there is indirect proof
how will tis grand battle end
but looking at it again theres noting really worthy of mention
sekitani juan didnt choose to become a hero
people say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their time in gig school
are the mystery masters
still not there
not like me
it wouldnt be tat unusual for someone to borrow tis every week right
satosi wat clubs are on the fourth floor
im envious
my summarys on the second page
it was on one of those nights tat it happened
was tat it
so bowd toe culprit kill im or rather
seems so
but you said tat five minutes ago
ten e called tamura again told im to stand up and started yelling at im
but swept by our passion we went too far wit the movement against them
citanda we wish you luck
they would have been able to tell if x wore is uniform
use your brain
could i have erred in my self assessment
please help me find out
well be betting on ibara reading into the fact tat it was dropped by the shed
you cant do a thing about it
handmade
tis room used to be the classic literature clubs room right
the six actors wo appeared on screen
there are quite a few old families in kamiyama
but ill explain from the beginning anyway
its nice
lets see the seventh question
youll be late
both satosi and i watched a drama wit tat event just earlier today
do i really want to become like tat
a a floor plan
and tat leads us to weter toe classics club or the partisan club will be targeted
tis doesnt look like an easy read
so all you want is for us to watch it and give our opinions
posting a new paper tis early
but fuku
even if se and to give up writing midway they couldve at least asked her about it
jokes must be improvised or theyre just common lies
when the general affairs committee finds unautorized posters and notes
thats so frustrating
explaining the shadow is simple
can we skip my turn and go right to the conclusion
quiz trial seven
and is whole life changed just for a culture fair
five seconds four
i asked my uncle wat does hyouka mean
i guess
are you some wild animal
but the exponential four are really famous
i suppose eyd write something like page st july class a
the genius did so well in a competition tat se was named mvp
look for the back of the boy burdened wit secrets
maybe hongou intended to write the whole script herself
fuku does get angry
mayakas probably at the school too so ill drop by to say i
well i doubt eyd actually be dancing
did hongou swan volunteer herself to write toe script
yes by chance
my uncles family wants closure as well
yea were leaving now
is something the matter
a string
its too late
hes totally engrossed in some indie manga hes been like tat for a while
he dropped out of kamiyama high
but we could try asking the executive committee president or the student council president directly
whats wrong wit it
seems so
deep or quick just keep breathing
its great
if someone steps on it they might get hurt
hes attending a tecnical school in osaka for tat
you wanted a scriptwriter not a detective
why do you ask
okay our hearts are as one
you were talking about yourself before right
i want to solve your mystery
the grass is always greener on the other side
its not like youre interested in anything else right
if tease would be detectives are still standing around ere
altoug late please accept my congratulations for passing your entrance exams
we might want to split up and look for it
could there be some reason why theyre all girls
damn im sleepy
either way im just a normal person
by the way wat brings you two ere
lets continue wit the class
they originally meant the same thing
issue number two
would it be possible to see the script
tis incident
tat card was in its place
the whole sting
every club is serious about wat they write about
citanda told me a little while ago in the clubroom
anyway lets look for a place to sleep tonight
my thanks here
in a real life murder maybe it could work
first and most importantly a guest really only as about five minutes on the sow
lets all go to the preview
hey first year
o ten lets ear wat you have to say
im sure ell accept it
wat ten is the key flaw of tis film
also we were told tat hongou senpais script was perfectly consistent
your beloved big suis is ere to see how youre doing arent you grateful
wasnt it because they wanted to give hongou a rest
are you serious
dead said not to tell anyone
but still we want to know the reason behind kindness
the principal might have tried to shorten the five days of cultural festival
tat applies to the other deadly sins as well
kamiyama city is next to a meteor tall range of mountains
were talking about sekitani juan right
it just came to me it was probably luck
really
how much
as for my sister
yes look at it closely
ten how do you tell whats good and whats bad
youre right tat is a little strange
my information overturns your theory
im bringing something etats incomplete closer to completion
well i guess
tis was because the club and many other people wit much more skill taen se did
we probably couldve kept meeting in the clubroom as usual
i think we need to talk
welcome to the blue mountain inn
lets do our best today too
i brought it to my uncle
we do not plan to disband after tis one work
sorry i figured we could work tat out later
they run the general hospital in town
because you look the same way at your friends
you could tie it to your arm and use it as a shield
the last crime will either be the classics club or the crafts club
everyone in a was talking about it at lunctime today
full of confidence i see
looking at their names theyre all girls
he just acts all uppity and tries to hide is emotions
there are over a thousand suspects
yea itd be terrible to end it all on a sour note like tat
the classic literature club is no exception
but there was noting like tat
satosi just told me about tis weird rumor
my default status is stocking pink after all
you were sitting at the lunch table when we left
light and dark are still vague in the distance
were going to release an antology at the culture fair in october
ill assume each classics club member buys two
lets go to the hot spring we went to yesterday
the saying actually goes theory and ointment will stick to anything
its the longest one
they probably have some trick to avoid being noticed by the council
when did the crafts guys get there
but why do you want to know about tat now
lets get tis meeting underway
the senate was the digest institutes of legislation
also theres another reason
there is some truth in the idea tat holmes is more for beginners mystery fans
im also in charge of lost kinds lost and found and breaking change
and why would they open the shutters just to sow it to us it doesnt make sense
thats a detective novel pretty ardcore
the rope didnt sow up in the movie
correct
the culture fair is the one great constant of all club traditions
tat got her attention good one ibara
so youll write about the classics club in return
tis sprouting warmth confuses us
but everyone kept quiet
the whole school was filled wit tension
was there some bidden connection between the clubs tat got it
yelp tough its probably just a coax by the club members
living up to your name as kaburaya junior higs best couple u
e pierced together evidence from a few sources
i guess thats it for me ten
well know wat happened years ago
im not doubting its autenticity
they say tat great talents bloom late but thats prater unlikely at tis point
wed like to see newspapers articles from may t tree years ago
if hongou wanted it to turn into a horror film halfway troug
the obi would kind of come off
sum i
if thats all i need to do yea
a mats teacher would be more likely to mistake the letter d for a
tis is just a guess but if we consider tis principals call for a focus on studying
theres always one mysterious posters tat doesnt belong to any club but it snows up every single year
and tat would be the way of tis incident
it didnt burn you
spread our wings wit more courage than ever before
the kamiyama high school classics club is four strong
he can only be useful if someone uses im
they are currently on their way to the arakubo area to gather material for their exibition
i guess my plans dont go as smoothly as yours
hasnt anyone invented glasses tat only let you look straight ahead
considering tat theyre in the same year but different classes wat subjects could it be
se tried to study mystery by reading holmes
have you been trying to find her
it really was the same person we found out is name too
one would be gaining wealth for everyone by producing gig value crops
if hongou wrote the script just based on the floor plan without seeing the place for herself
wat kind of a movie is it
the moonlight stone troug the open windows and revealed the ranging mans shadow
yea we should do something more flasy
im already in the handicraft club and student council tough
want a charm
you finally got it
you reached out to touch my heart it must be because of you
if you randomly selected five students from tis school
wait a moment we have no way of knowing wat else hongou had read
tat should be enough reason to stock it on the website
your theory is too abstract
they need to keep up wit any minor changes made to the students editions after all
are a magic tat only unfolds in the night
find me i beg you
why the cover illustration is like tat
you idiot
wat comes to mind when you think of a mystery
you could tie it to your leg and hide it under your skirt
se seems to have and her reasons for everything
and so now exactly did it happen
alrigt im going to the staff room turning in my omework and going home
so we suspect the same guy
b but it contains
ten why did you bother confirming your own unc today
se told me you were friends wit toe writer of tis manga
light and dark are still vague in the distance
just now limited are your energy supplies
if the culprit wasnt one of those six theres only one explanation
thats a great start
if es taking notes
its about my uncle his name was sekitani juan
tat concludes my report
are a magic tat only unfolds in the night
naturally were going to look for tat posters
is tat okay
tis places fortunes feel like theyll come true
and putting out fires wit buckets is just boring
it feels like it might have originated there
a itll probably take about half an our to get the articles is tat okay
should i bring you a wet towel
as nobody as joined tis year they plan to to disband it
and guessed wat happened years ago
a different person borrows it every week and they all return it on the same day
and wo decided to make a movie
wat do you mean fuku
theres a stove in the main all
dont you think its weird
so its something you dont want citanda and ibara to ear
followed by questions regarding the information
when you said everyone should take pride in their abilities was tat all a lie
so thats wat happened to my uncle years ago
let us meet in a blissful dream tonight let it be our love
wat does tat mean
deep or quick just keep breathing
i have heard tat the club currently as no members remaining
ten take a break
ten the incident was in june while the expulsion was in october
for instance the volume of blood se and us prepare was not nearly enough
now all thats left is the juumoji incident
so its not possible thank you
se knows wat happened to your uncle
hongou wrote tis script according to the rules tough
do you really think a low energy person like me would want to be responsible
could it be some kind of secret message
whats tis floor map
why did you go to all the trouble to set tat up just to divert her from the piano rumor
there are two possibilities
thats my motto
but tis year it really was a once in a lifetime sight
but all clubs could cited such circumstances
why did i even come ere
ten you could have the clubroom all to yourself
yea we should be able to find material ere
wat do you mean by infrared sensors
if we can do it today dwy leave it for tomorrow
so opposition had formed to the sortening of the culture fair
for just yen
anyway see you
tough ill probably never meet im again
a little too lively
the official leader of the movement sekitani sand
drums
ten i guess thats the end of my turn
i guess
youko written wit the character for raise isnt very common
its not like se was a huge mystery buff or anything
we have no time until the opening ceremony
the siblings citanda imagines
but my wallet and my exalt are both fine
great accomplishment
yea tat arm was really well done
wouldnt they normally stick together
yea i slept like a baby
there was no way the students could justify tat
the sole screenwriter for tis one our movie was a girl called hongou mayu
i think itd be awesome to promoter you as the president of juumojis final target
youre in the classics club right oreki
yes in the classics club calling it tat is taboo
sekitani juan defending toe kanya festival
if we cant find them ere well have to search the entire school
number
ten lets go wit oreki sans theory and use tis story for tis years antology
just shut up and do your omework
come to think of it ive noticed a rattling sound under the floor for a while now
and the archives are inside
i can
the cameraman was filming from the six actors point of view
and as you saw the locations is special so it can only be filmed during summer vacation
if i and one from the start it wouldve been perfect
im sorry to barges in as an outsider
yea but tat might be misleading
really
something quite pungent like paint thinner
have a nice trip
the second of kamiyama higs seven wonders or something like tat
i can
to save energy
ive been trying to think of ways to lure customers ere all tis time
lets see the fool actually more like the magician
lets see
walk wit a doll
the role of the detective
i think there were people in my class wo couldve solved the problem
and your poor grades arent is fault
when i see you it makes it harder for me to relax
the cloudy sky tells a tale of wants to come
citanda around when did you finish telling ghost stories and go to bed
youre right
sorry doesnt ring a bell
howd e get out
ive got library duty
wat if someone needs something from tis shed and opens the door
the teachers didnt know how to react to tis action
youre listening to yosino yasukunis radio beat special edition
ten lets talk to mars itoigawa
se didnt seemed too surprised
tat was a real tragedy
i bet tat shadow back ten was kayo as well
ten lets put my theory aside for now
why do you think e does tat
third dig a tunnel under the wall
call it a database please
fifty period today was mats class
we ope you enjoy the performance the magic club as prepared just for you
woa theres a classics club
thank you very much for yelping find out wat happened to my uncle
thats not true either
se studied mystery quite torougly
global acting club debates club we even had a karuta club
they mustve said it was probably a kamiyama high student
why are you apologizing
the cultural festival will be held for a spirited five days again tis year
kawasaki said e didnt know
right
wit only in the class tis would be impossible to film
its more like theyre making fun of how perfect se is
o something more official
id really like to come to a decision on tis script
tis is about the classics club
im surprised its still around
refreshment boots are traditionally banned at the kamiyama high cultural festival
will all be carried along by the river of time into the distant past
i get the feeling you might run into a few issues
you shut yourself in the toilet trying to figure it out dwy
hear about the wall ewspaper club
quit staring at my woman
i wouldnt say it was particularly big or small
did i change the question to match the answer
the origin of the name kanya fair
wat i wanted to ask you was
sounds good
we met by the stairs
but still we want to know the reason behind kindness
o nevermind its noting
we sold fourteen copies
either way its likely tat the police got involved wit x in order to trace were the bill came from
and i cant remember any other details
by the way akajou
youll see stuff like friday the t or igtmare on elm street right
but still we want to know the reason behind kindness
let us meet in a blissful dream tonight let it be our love
the art room
youre just saving energy right
id like for you to watch it and give me your honest opinions
o a punk
wat do you think a bit lame right
im sure your gaze doesnt mean anything
were after whats in the medicine safe
from the looks of it theyre also sceduled to work at the festival
was there a problem during filming
omici is a mats teacher
there are thirty bulletin boards altogether
dont talk about people like tat
but it was something tat the owners wouldnt have immediately noticed if not for the letter
i dont know wat se wanted
yesterday it trained so the sun set behind the clouds
you just wanted to old on to the status quon
can i see tat
one bag for yen
the mattresses were soft and fluffy too right
it needed to be contained within the administration
i dont know her well enough to judge tat
so id like to ear all your stories
o well
we can say for sure tat there was a note specifying a later page in the book
i want to reclaimd my memory before my uncle dies
and tat would be konaris son right
theres no contradiction
do you have a pond in your garden
since ten many people wo stayed in room seven
because thats the writers own interpretation
o one went near the stage except the performers
last year it was just the time and place for a meeting written on a scrap of paper
youre armd working you dont eat much
we could do tis all day
they managed to persuade the groundskeeper to let us use it
i dont think i really enjoy the mystery genre all too much
the one tat calls for over deaths is impossible
tis is the true message tat sekitani juan left behind
hey did you forget wat our format is
the time difference before expulsion
did anything get moved around when you switched clubrooms
wed be grateful if you could bring them to the earth science prep room
why are we waiting ere
tough we havent found any posters yet
tat we may get over tat mountain
you reached out to touch my heart it must be because of you
do you have any questions
so wat about tis mr ogi
if you slide down the cliffs behind the inn you end up right ere at the cot springs
a promise for when we sleep
is withered grass in the wind
i cant
at kamiyama high midterms have begun
se was very skilled in
it looks like fun
but people will be talking about hyouka
its not even eight oclock yet
its for citandas sake isnt it
tat took you a while
a present from sount america
congratulations to the people wo got it right
se was drawn to the music room by the melody
sure ten ill
the little shooting stars we wisp upon vanishing into the dawn
i guess
my sister graduated two years ago
the girls blazing eyes stared at her across the room from under half closed eyelids
the moonlight sonatas delicate beauty reached her ears from the music room
i write to you wit these questions
pe or arts classes right
doctors suffer accidentlife ten years since the accidentkamikakiuci accidents the most casualties yet wounded deadkamikakiuci accident victim saved by elicopterman fell in the kamikakiuci mountainsaccident in the kamikakiuci mats search in progressguidebook to prevent accidents in the kamikakiuci mountains
unlike rire kayo does morning exercises every day
efficient u
find me i beg you
i hadnt come up wit it by tat point
even just today how many times already as citanda done or said something unexpected
and wit it end my quiet energy saving days
the left wing was a locked room
it was the principal wo strew gunpowder onto the fire
so its in my closet buried inside a box at the very back
senpai could you not kick me while im down like tat
during the movement the students boycotted their classes
but se probably would have just picked a random couple and got rid of everyone else
yes thats right
wat else do you need to ask me about
the seventh character waited for everyone else to vanish into the theater
well houtarous lack of emotions aside
if we can do it today dwy leave it for tomorrow
its just the writers opinion after all
whats wit tat look
i looked into the back issues of kami high monthly tat the wall ewspaper club published
thats weird enough on its own right
well find it im sure
ten wat did the mysterious thief juumoji make some fatal mistake
the most i can do is reconcile ibaras theory wit the new facts
his arm was cut off before they entered the room after all
if we believe bolt hyouka and alliance and salutes
houtarou have you never heard of the citandas
if it were up to me
i tougt tat was your motto
and i became interested in it as well
as you might imagine its more about the destination than the journey
and people remember the big point of their lives as their gig school days
ten a rescue team
i can think of a few things you wouldnt envy
im toe classics clubs president citanda eru
my name is eru
at any rate even if we cant solve the mystery
without considering the students they shortened the fair from five to two days
a piano club member wo died in an accident on the eve of the national competition
i cant imagine how anyone could have entered tat room
the darkness of dusk was closing in
youre probably to blame for calling out to my heart
the senate was the digest institutes of legislation
please enter your name anyway thanks in advance
but if the meaning of the text depends on tat
each grain of rice is a drop of sweat
is tat a letter from your sister
o you were the key
the only connection to the outside was the window and as you can see
ill bring it tomorrow ten
its just your typical school history book
and the classics club
why didnt sibazaki say yesterday at koubundou instead
how it doesnt matter whose name it may be
the murder was not a planned action
thats not funny
is old mr juumonji still in good dealt
do you feel like theres anything tat only you can do
why do you have tat
ongoing accidents among year old peopleaccident in alaska dead doctors suffer accidentlife ten years since the accidentkamikakiuci accidents the most casualties yet wounded deadkamikakiuci accident victim saved by elicopterman fell in the kamikakiuci mountains
but there isnt much for me to gain from it
wat kind of culprit would just stand around putting up a posters after the fact
yea those posters might be working
thats how a first year student would think
so basically
he should definitely understand the meaning behind it
there was a battle in june of the previous year
and finally we will consider their validity
and was unlucky enough to get locked inside
in other words hongou didnt care tat the window wouldnt work
in return
the school as lots of clubs
could you be quiet for a moment
yes tat means the key to solve the mystery was sown fair and square
ive done it the investigators still dont know my identity
i guess thats it citanda
tat name brings back memories
the family uses the first floor of the main building and the annex was out of the question
sum im the leader of the classic literature club
you reached out to touch my heart it must be because of you
ogi liked elicopters didnt e
thats why they couldnt object went y gave them back a counterfeit
it kinda happened after the fact
damn it wo did tis
thanks for your advice
how it doesnt matter whose name it may be
i cant stop thinking about it
but se didnt because it wasnt
o idea
houtarou hey
ill just deal wit the rest tomorrow
according to salute and solidarity the incident was in june
obunagas sister oici sent a bag tied at bolt ends to obunaga wo was at the front lines
lunch is ready
and my uncle fought them and became a hero
i shouldnt have agreed wit it just like tat
the door wasnt locked
tis girl
deep or quick just keep breathing
the script
so someone suggested a route tat crossed the tooji bridge instead
thats wat i tougt
enthusiasm is no substitute for skill as you can see ere
deep or quick just keep breathing
why not theyre sisters
i dont want to
if you find the antologies while were gone
a number of volunteers from class f decided to take part in the kanya fair
if it was a mistake wo made it and how
going troug toe lobby put them at risk of being seen by someone
it would be easy to say its a coincidence
like a dog
its been clear to me from the beginning tat they lack the skills necessary to solve tis mystery
wat do you mean
how was the drama
maybe thats why theres no detective role in the script itself
the dog is the school and the rabbits are the students
and retaken from the corpse scene at the next shooting and itll all match up
the magic clubs fifty sowing will begin shortly
as part of the trick they couldnt have gone anywhere near the locked room
is there a problem
ten wat do you think of wat haba said
its true theyve already begun work
deep or quick just keep breathing
speaking of expectations
looking at all these posters again tis school never fails to impress me
he was going on about taking a sneak peek at some summer fashion sting
threatening the casiers and stealing toe proceeds
so you wouldnt need to keep borrowing the same book every week
they look like real rabbits
if the sekitani incident and tis legendary movement were separate
but thats far too lame for a mystery
and leave the school heroically sacrificing is colorful gig school life
im in the handicraft club after all
i want to solve your mystery
ten could my eyes have been playing tricks on me
sacrifice
a capella choir go club fortune teller club
the final target toe classics club stands ready to intercept toe thief
after all ayako is also my friend
ten the incident occurred in june and sekitani juan left in october
just consider it for a moment oreki
hes just like mayaka said
and if the manga slab had something to do wit it mayaka wouldve mentioned it
but they definitely exist
ten wat do you think citanda
and watch the culprit confess crying like a baby
o outing less than an antology will do
if itll be fixed tomorrow ten why not fix it right now
a gloomy customers turned up once a long time ago
its written as a small tree true and pure ogi masakiyo
how it doesnt matter whose name it may be
theres a decent chance theyll all be girls
the cloudy sky tells a tale of wants to come
the assistant director toe prop master and the marketing manager
its not a bad offer
thats a good idea lets make tat our main approach
tis sprouting warmth confuses us
wat is tougaitos family famous for
whatever lets just get tis over wit already
we cant be productive if we have no purpose
not mutations imitation
light and dark are still vague in the distance
if you read it normally it just says ten letters
he told them i dont need meals or room service just stay away
but im sure sell be among the best in our year
you could say tat most people around me live colorful lives as well
but you saw wat was sown in the video
youre still oblivious to my feelings
tat will be the key to deducing the crime x committed
a reckless person citanda eru
or was it yours
the more inexperienced you are the more you want to sow off
ten letters
fuku was oreki actually smart all along
i guess
gardening club cooking slab dews posters club magic club
were close souled only be about five more minutes
wouldnt it stand out the most there
tis is boring
ten lets watch it again
but we discarded tat yesterday
right a vengeful ghost
to clear out a smell
i like tat
many people from their family work in education in fact
whats more i remember my mother came running in surprise
ace detective
se said se and to go to the manga lamb
her regrets and her screams would be hidden within
expectations u
its sort for air to ground missiles
and anyway the whole point of tis was to sow tat my theories can be completely off from reality
the classic literature clubs antology
very important preparatory work vice president
he watched the elicopter until we couldnt see it anymore
you should be able to find them in the clubroom
ogi was worried about weter toe prefectural police elicopter would fly over us
tis is haba tomoiro toe propos master
so how can i help you
i tougt toe movie was a blast you know
you sure look apply
o im certain
but today ill be introducing you to the people wo would play the detective
you might be able to kill some time wit tis but it all depends on you
im afraid mystery isnt my forte
also consider the way se reacted when we told her we were the classics club
id like to consider wat happened to the classics club years ago
tat was just dumb luck
i cant stop thinking about it
if you yell right now wat do you think will happen
kaitous arm was really well done
anger is a grave sin
i looked at other years and thats most likely correct
the word darui originates from the english word dull
wo on earth is tis second contestant of theirs
looks like kayo didnt write ears
yea toe mushrooms feel threatened by the strong electric current
i cant lock up afterward
is tat true
but the librarian is at a staff meeting right now so we cant go in
his big school days came to an end
your motto is none other than
is it too hard
o way
having siblings in reality isnt wonderful in the slightest
the head priest is an acquaintance of ours
at least it could be
the citanda farmer family as one of the best mansions in kamiyama
theres a floor plan ere
sorry you cant go there now
the truth is ive always wanted a sibling
the gardening clubs water gun was an ak wasnt it
im sorry but we dont have any of the previous antologies in the archive
houtarou citanda swan im coming to help
youre the president of the classics club
are you sure tis legendary movement is the same incident in wick sekitani june was expelled
were you planning to confess to me or something
but you said tat theyve always been prohibited
we shall begin wit takamura youicis act living dead
w wait please
you have to ask
see now youve gone and made her mad
a setting
and weve sold another nine in total since tis morning
yes thats wat were trying to do
it all becomes part of the classics as per the rules of historic perspective
bingo
im coming wit you
whats wit tat look
you couldnt have chosen a better time to tell me
if someone goes missing for seven years
i dont really get it
i think i migtve seen something of my uncle in you
the others realized it too and the classroom got a bit noisy
i want to solve your mystery
a promise for when we sleep
i tougt youd say tat
fading into the dawn my tiny waising star
im using my legs to divide the wind tis feeling
how tat you mention it we had to carry a few cardboard boxes
i just summarized their theories
why didnt e try to calm me down
weve come so far from just one sentence
wat an amazing dead eat
wat happened years ago when my uncle attended toe school
we still dont know wat each team is making
the classics clubs prior antologies arent kept in the library
tat was quite impressive houtarou
the five days is the result of the hero sekitani juns battle
and the reason for the incident was
thats one way to put it
geniuses couldnt avez normal lives like us even if they wanted to
yea envy doesnt fit her at all
for five weeks in a row
i think it was a yukata hung up by the window
it took a lot of effort for katsuta to even open it
we should choose symbols of our own
so ill solve it myself
it should start wit the character for living
i cant believe tis
we have no purpose
were holding the finals over ere
we should never be content wit being a small and insignificant school and so on
swimming trunks and oreki dont mix either
perhaps the kanya festival may have been targeted by such people tat year
im really sorry
well at least youre relaxing
but still we want to know the reason behind kindness
theres an unused drug safe inside
those clothes look good on you
tis sprouting warmth confuses us
tis may be a bit random but wat kind of person is your sister
but the window
i wonder
so se waited until everyone fell asleep
onettless if you have something worthy of everyones attention
sounds good today was pretty cool
when i called her tis morning tough se was still in bed wit a angover
wat a wonderful picture
why did they old a meeting to discuss the cultural festival only once years ago
to enter the office were the master key was they had to go troug toe lobby
im also interested to see how long itll take for it to reach me in class d
wat is it fuku can
if youve got an idea of your own say it
you reached out to touch my heart it must be because of you
spread our wings wit more courage than ever before
there are legends about im wit way more impact tough
how about we take a walk by the river
cocolate tat you just melt and resape isnt omemade
wat should we do
oreki could i trouble you to deliver a message
itd have to be a special exception
thats in the other building
a number of volunteers from class f decided to take part in the kanya fair
you already filled out your application after all
you want to know about tat movement years ago right
first cii canst theory is rejected
maybe im still sick from tat bust ride
it was when i got ere
wat do i think
the secret club
i was just wondering if it really was good enough
something smells like the book
we also know from kami high monthly tat the entire student body was involved
tat was your first mistake
its hard to analyze myself like tat
im for celebrating
one of our part timers for today tripped a pot
im wearing laceless boots today
ten lets do tat in my office
it isnt locked
i told rire tat i would help her wit per omework
thank you so much for your yelp yesterday
will team classics club make it
lets put together wat we know first
were selling friend potatoes at the acting club
l looking
ten let me count on tat luck
it was written years ago like cii canst
why wasnt my uncles tale an epic
i take tat back
o other questions
well it was just by chance
its one of the seven deadly sins
im busy
o you want a sister of your own citanda
they only have ten minutes left
first tat they have noting in common
because you look the same way at your friends
i guess
how about you any good material
itd be pretty cool raving your own private corner of the school right
tat fits you perfectly today
a youre right
they made tis announcement after class right
dont you understand tis feeling yet
and the cultural festival was held in october
we cant make any posters to advertise it yet either
youre still burning up
and the classics club at tat
theyre on break today
im not sure your life still counts as normal tough
hold on
i just need to make the best omemade cocolate ever
better give up
sibazaki might be intending to provide educational guidance to student x
lets take the east stairs
tat rare flags of sparkling brilliance
popular u
come in
se told me to find a rope tat someone could bang off and wouldnt break
dont boost is ego or ell get carried away
thats not even funny
my uncle went to india seven years ago
wat did you intend by making me join
actually per sense of smell is even more of a mystery to me
se lowered the rope from the second floor
the tree man team event
o way you
you traveling alone
the cloudy sky tells a tale of wants to come
whats up houtarou did the eat overload your brain again
so you really did figure something out houtarou
now i can truly say goodbye to my uncle
hey could you at least pretend to be motivated
apparently it was the biology prep room
and if people didnt envy one another
the train and the buds together took more than an our
moderation in all things right
and wouldnt the rooms be locked
you really dont know went to shut up
but today was different
yea tough its just a plastic replica
but we dont know if its every week
the cloudy sky tells a tale of wants to come
i didnt mean to embarrass you
wit the heroic leadership of the classics club president sekitani june and our determination and action
and at the peak of tat
i think it means tat the conflict wasnt as glamorous as people make it out to be
if only the thief would target toe classics club
youre late
why was the classics clubs antology called hyouka
by any chance were we in the same music class
tis is an excerpt from the first issue of alliance and salutes
how is it
wat if there are students wo prefer to keep a low profile
you locked it from the inside didnt you
if i were the culprit i dont think id take tis route either
ten tat evening a piercing scream ecoed trougout the inn
they were all so serious
i get wat youre trying to say but
i cant find it
are we going to set up a new stalls
youve summed it up well
i wont tone myself down to fit in
but wat will happen if you take off the obi string
omici teaces mats every year
wat exactly happened to my uncle years ago
go ahead wit any questions
but there was no sign anyone and used stem
pretty exciting u
its so urge itd be easier to just borrow it again each week than to take it come wit you
ill take one
mr ogi was a mountaineer
the title
and you fuku
take my struck and check
you may have just wanted to reject der
tis is the script
thats when the narrative structure itself is used to mislead the reader right
something youve gotta do
all club activities are put on old during the exams
it looks so elegant
but i forgot to bring something to use as a formal pocket accessory
join the classics club
the heir of a family famous in the field of education
burst out at kami high in the form of the culture fair
theres plum dried fist and mustard greens
so they made citandas uncle sekitani juan take responsibility
and thats why you sorted things out in such a roundabout way
there is something in ere tat as to do wit my uncle
im sorry but please look elsewhere
im sure theyre recruiting tis year as well
i wanted to go straight to the entrance turning my omework in at the staff room on the way
the common link is tat theyre all girls and all in second year but different classes
well it turned out as expected
ten let us conclude tis preview
o citanda wouldnt believe tat
theyre sisters but they cant even lend their clothes to each other
we promised to meet drifting in and out of sleep
ive never seen someone look so out of place at the end of a table
he entered the left wing and locked it himself
when did you enter the room
so tat smell was paint
wat can we conclude from the fact tat someone different borrows it each week
l lokking
but no one and volunteered to be the leader
but if you were clever enough to run a secret club youd try to outwit people in a more dignified way
did you get nervous or something
how it doesnt matter whose name it may be
now i know both the author and the illustrator
the magic clubs magic sow will now begin
maybe i should go check it out tomorrow
so much for me being a detective
the teacher got even angrier and launched into a airs tirade
in order to do tat you have to make them feel mentally satisfied at working for you
your class hasnt studied range yet right
its not like you to go to school on a holiday wat gives
but the range of x was restricted
and besides a database cant draw any conclusions
we can assume tat the actors could see the seventh character moving around
hi there miss empress
it was a joke
thats right
lets just call for help
you dont have to take it so seriously
and prepare myself for the funeral as well
anyway you can read off without me
so we can infer tat hongou didnt intend to have a large number of deaths
i cant stop thinking about it
the school didnt involves the police
would you like to join us as our guest for our lunctime sow
at the culture fair committee meeting at the end of june
youll be holding the umbrella for the citanda girl right
wat symbols
im just a database so i cant draw conclusions
o man at marketing were in like such a bind without the title
thatll be yen
satosi do you have the floor map
and i have a huge favor to ask of to you
but the sound suddenly stopped
team classics club as put boiled potatoes and potato starc in a mortar
ill have another coffee please
looking for the person wo makes tis happen to me again today
the cloudy sky tells a tale of wants to come
but ill keep all tis in mind
okay so tis is goodbye for today
at the very least theyre definitely related somehow
wat do you mean
thats why id like to ask you all to come to the classics club
yea toe cherry tree tat was blooming out of season
a about your part fuku
thats not wat i meant dwy room seven
let me get tis straight fuku can
call murai o call akagawa construction
smash troug toe prelims and aim for the top
and as it loses all subjectivity
but do you have any proof its really mars itoigawa
of course not
and her final piece of bad luck was tat we started investigating tat shadow
in truth se doesnt want to get angry herself
se and a bad attitude
but if im found in ere wit you today
ten how would you do it ibara
please continue
outing its a bit personal
expectations
wat do you mean
can i really believe in myself
our porch is very pleasant
u about tat
ten you gaitered your classmates and asked them to play detective
sorry things got all weird like tis
all the time mostly oolong tea
you were totally into it as well
hey did you see it on tv yesterday
in other words the culprit is still on the fourth floor
im running away to fuku can
citanda is in the way
theres a students only cat room on the schools omepage
firstly the problem wit akajous theory was
the curtains were closed and the room was dark
look it doesnt say anything about it being a tree man team
tat alone spokes a hole in juumojis pattern
im a bit interested
wat are you talking about
wit so many flyers ere unautorized ones dont stand out
o youre tat good
hongou was looking for another actor besides those six
the lid of the piano was open but no pianist was to be seen
colorful u
after minutes you must switc out for the next member
not to mention tat my sister referred to it as a tragedy
so whats tis dirty story of yours
most likely because the student body and pressing demands
ten se was asked the following question in an interview
it was quite well done after all
thats not the case
it seems like i dont
omici is using the fourth edition wick was published tis year
in tat way their performance is quite lacking
did your family grow tis rice
yes when they rebuilt the rest of the school years ago
a sin
dont worry im sure ses just scared of big men
spread our wings wit more courage than ever before
im just true to my own motto
its not ere tough
youre really weird
you might consider it a confession
if you borrow it friday afternoon and return it the same day
thats when i got angry
i ate tat many
you can discover the amazing secrets buried witing kanya fairs year history for yourselves
ses the empress
no one said juumoji would steal it during the performance
ten its possible se tougt there was another open route
sawakiguci misaki toe publicity manager
it is
yes at the mizunasi shrines living china festival girls take on the dolls roles
ten we should ask her about it before we start looking
tat was the spark tat ignited the whole uproar
did you find anything
tarot of course
its a good manga too
wat happened to my uncle years ago
could tat mean something
the word kongouseki means diamond
tat it makes the mystery seem uninteresting as well
but not as much as me
secondly you must make the classics club famous
thats not now you save energy
wouldnt they stop inventing new things
theyre not praising per anymore
there are two it doesnt matter wick
im happy every day
werent you the one wo got angry in omicis class during fifty period
if anyone and climbed troug the window there would definitely have been tracks left in the grass
ayako and haruna were friends too
it is in essence the second locked room
yea rejected
just take your time looking for clues
a secret
youve never borrowed a book from ere have you
ill fix the difference in how we view our youths right now
since books can be borrowed for up to two weeks
is a variation on kudryavkas order
its not anywhere in the room
sorry but they have to be in ere somewhere
tis alliance and salutes tinge looks kind of sadly
the first one was the lack of blood
everyone in tired year
satosi noted them ere
the acting and directing and some and limbs so tat was pretty fun
why did you choose us the classics club
satosi openly praising someone is the world ending
ill tell you later
the way you said it just ten sounded like a mere excuse
it looks like team classics club as finished their giseyaki
if we can find out the truth
wat are you talking about
wat do you mean
the door wick everyone used to get in and the window
its a strange story
i guess you could say tat
the mysterys been solved after all
ill teach you the basics of how to speak on air
se probably got too scared to sow us some crappy manga
but it was a wonderful ending all the same
but there were only six characters on screen
you knew wat was going to happen and still you said noting
was hongou swan aware of tat
its not ere
student activism
thats right we need to wait for the librarian
thats why se tougt tat the window was possible
id like to ask a very special favor of you
if thats true ten whats the point
l is tat okay
do you have the classic literature clubs antologies
it would be impossible to open tat window silently while hanging from a rope
is it because of the zenna sisters
ill ask my father to call the worsippers representatives
could it be because the actual characters tat spell kanya
the stage and the backstage passage were full of junk blocking the way right
have you asked any of the actors
but my uncle didnt even try to calm me down
good afternoon tougaito
the more inexperienced you are the more you want to sow off
are there any inconsistencies
a russian assault rifles
id love to go there one day
it would be terrible if tis movie wasnt completed
tis is the only record tat talks about wat happened years ago
you dont need to feel bad about it citanda sand
theyre still talking about tat u
according to my sister twos been to the kamikakiuci mountains
when the police asked the koubundou owners if they had any idea wo it might be
yea were tied
bored sitting on the windowsill
how about the quiz club first
give me a break
save some room for dessert
next up
ibara mayaka from the classics club
so wo would have done tat
come on dont put it like tat
theres no point expecting so much from im chi
you make me sound evil
thats right
must be difficult to be born into a family wit history
do you remember tat woman wit the red swimsuit
wat can you do wit a book besides reading it
its been five minutes
oreki i said in the dressing room tat i was going to call the head priests right
but i cannot remain silent about it
wat color
o knoxs
were doing a fashion sow
yea club meeting after class we need to discuss something
last year tanabe president of the student council tried to make contact wit team after seeing their posters
light and dark are still vague in the distance
well its true tat there are problems wit is theory
because ive been defying toe moderators
well be rewarded for defeating you
after all sizuku can youre my best friend
i dont mind
lets cheer them on
si zu kuz
whats your objective
tis isnt a confession its a trap
thats right
atsuru swan will you lend me your strength
two mighty forces are locked in an unending battle
only the people the moderators choose can do it
if you choose me as a girl tat is
thanks to you my plan was ruined
we dont need the male atsuru
im going to defeat your friends after all
it seems es the original messenger
but i wont team up wit you
o dont tell me you
dont get so angry bitch
im her partner
fuck yea my hearts on fire
umm blood falls like rain even when the sky is clear
therell be lots more were tat came from after you defeat them
were more interested in kisses taen fights
just wo do you think you are
when were alone you should call me sizuku
tat looks fun
are you a moderator
at least
my conversing wit im just bridged is dream to reality
im sorry agi
each are parts of a whole connected at the roots
it may have been the best thing to do for her
ill ask im
many of the music migrated along wit it
yea i dont mind
let them be they wont last much longer anyway
by planting something thats not natural into the ground
the green wine cups missing
i suppose
a child from the village
or was it the musics fault
a bad dream
grandpa looks at the fog every morning and decides
people tat avez tis power are rare
w wat is tis smoke
orange
wat do you mean forget it
too bad they werent a new species u
hes still at it
i had given up already
a cipped green wine cup
theres fewer animals and the koumyaku is shifting
o noting
well you must have a reason tough
theres only one way for me to live ere
just one for most
theres all sorts of strange things
i bought it from a collector friend of mine
it breeds in darkness
hes about ten years old write air green eyes
tis is useless
tis is some of the earlier liquid music
at tis point its hard to distinguish between plant and animal
and the thumb represents plants
yea i guess
over the next ten some years
the sound of weaving
are you done doing the laundry
uro sans are music tat cant survive for long outside of a closed room
its tis year
the moon
theres no way it could be our village
wataiko were are the children
i cant be sleeping
it causes a rejection reaction and forms into a gall
it was two years before isana wasborn tat my husband died
theyre getting weaker
the mountain
the mountains energy is settledwen theres a blue tint
umm the suns rays slowly soften the trees are sprouting and the birds
come on its getting late lets find an inn
did you get to read my letter
her name is siege
in japan left landed children were commonly made to write wit their right and
after tat there were no more new rumorsabout the boy wit toe goodly left and
i want you to examine tat living god
theres no other way
its hard to figure out wat music it is from just tis
its tat man from earlier
well i was going to sell it to you no matter what so
my whole future is set
from now on its okay to ask for tis much
if i run someone else will become the living god
but eventually
the one igt bridge
dont worry
furthest away from the heart at the tip of the middle finger
we cant work anymore
a rainbow
do you think taku can play the right cards by himself
your grandmother didnt need long to decide
are you still worried about your mother
im just going for a walk
i had to find someone wo could cure her
o if so the bearing should have returned
you guys be careful
tat music is the heart of the kagebi
to go from ere to the village will be good training
itll be okay join
when im by myself sometimes things like tat just come out of nowhere
that will be best for both him and the world
i know its hard to believe
i feel anxious
why didnt i notice
tis is a problem
a rainbow will appear
jiisama will not be ere for much longer
half of a green sake cup
but the grandmoter tat returned home was not the same as before
when all are seltering within
i do sense music in it as well
im okay
its quiet
i was just writing you a letter of refusal
it mixes wit the water and evaporatesand turns into fog
we went into your storeouse today
will e get well
really ice
deep and vivid
the sake cup tat se got from the music
well ill take my time
tis is a map of the local underground waterways
as if in sympathy kouki continued to flow from the cup
thats good
echo your voice across the neighboring mountains
ten for a moment there was pitch black darkness
it is a living entity called kouki
every now and ten theres someonecooking in these mountains
is tat my dream on the screen
note ayu is a type of sweet fils found in japan
forgive me for doing tis
hey whats up wit tis large catch
shut up where do suggest we go back to
even such rice
you kept it safe because you said it was really expensive
we were all like family it was a nice village
theres more than in the mountains at home
it is
i dont think setsu would have known
really
i feel a little guilty
these sounds are
ever since my grandmoter died four years ago
kisuke brought me happiness despite wat i am
and vanished from the mountains byte time the storms had passed
hey everyone hows the mountain
tat is the truth but
of course i dont
true darkness
its hard to make someone understand a world they have never seen
i cant be wasting my time
the life spain of that mushi is about a day
the leaves are turning red and the birds
its wat becomes the source of a musics life
ive heard from an old fiserman
tsunami
tis must be my punishment
sometings wrong wit the mountains
se left half of herself on the other side
its pretty
said my grandmoter and se forbade me to write wit my left and
you should be weakening by now
ive seen it before its a ugecatfis wit grass on its head
he stayed on the island for a month
we have good arrangements for her if se comes back
im sorry an inkstone
contrary to its name its not a plant
well ten say i to me if you ever see me somewhere
since there are some tat can mimic umans
i want you to tell me wat you know
like the green in tis land
tat was it
hey you bird
but i didnt mean it
but honestly i never tougt it would happen so soon
shut up
well i make a living dealing wit stem
youre one of them
tat was a miracle creature ten
but beautiful flowers still
it strings my skin
a swamp tat leads to the sea
hes never seen it happen himself
if end just reconsider on seeing tis inkstone
ill give you a sip
were leaving
its a huge pot
here you go
i think youre doing good
after sunset well begin suis treatment
it must be because of tat dreadful power of yours
hey ginko time for breakfast
its okay
honestly i didnt think you would either
i understand but aunt
seem the basic elements from wick life is born
the ink rubs well wit it too
i want to examine it
i dont mind spoiling my hands a bit
its cold
i cant give it to you any cheaper
and ten everything went black
se was just a normal girl
o way damn it
the fogs plain white
i tougt it was strange
how about suis eyeballs
i suppose
out of ten one or two
m music
water dead
wat he didnt even say goodbye
the pond
it was an extremely
one night
they always showed up before the summer rainy season
but i was afraid of finding out wat happened to im
chapter two
kisuke will be fine
i tougt se resembled my moterwen se was a baby
so when you want real darkness
the second eyelids
beings tat are close to life itself
all alone
and theres noting tat can be done
how many people do you think will come back once they leave ere
ses always been on the slow side
and rarely people
beautiful sound
behind our eyelids you know there is another pair of eyelids
i had no idea
i dont know if tis will do the trick but
hey theres some water over there
doctor
water
imagination
different light
tat rumor is just cramp isnt it
chapter one
tis is the tecnique etats beenpassed down in my family
i wonder if e is someone else than the one eyed man suis was talking about
there are those
for only a short time
i never would have tougt tat toseweeds were young hidane
theyre my family
yeah some are transparent like ghosts
yea it is
am i mistaken
the person wo is sacrificed as no choice
keep it a secret from grandma
its because i turned the cloth over
all i know is tat in the country to the west there was a bridge tat didnt break
ill ask you again sometime
thats probably waits going on
isnt tat right
if youre not going to investigate imyou souled drop by whenever youre around
and as if in sympathy
tell me normal stuff
it looks like a new type
how how should i compose the next one
tis land used to be a koumyakusujibut it got abandoned
every one of them
hes the guy tat takes care of all the villages ceremonies
there are a lot of uro sank in tis area
i was always wit der
well thats how it is
so are you staying ere until ten
or boats carrying no passengers
many children were born frail
from the time a person opens his eyes to the light
i wonder if its some type of music
there are times when i just want to take a break
its a big cocoon tat two pupa make together right
i want to go on alone for now
fine wit me i dont have any other plans
mountains
a map of wat they tougt the rivers would be like from a couple hundred years ago
it sounded like you were leaving the village
did you know tat theres a part of the ear tat looks just like a snail
the source of life flows troug tis land
i will assist
its still a top notc inkstone
promise me tat we wont call her mania
hey toyo are you alone again
and ten
someone elses house you say is it yours
thats impossible
wo brought the seed back from somewhere
the grounds out and it smells weird
a music pin u
o kidding youd never think they wereconcealed for hundreds of years
its a lively village
tis urge catfis the shape of tis swamp
yea they are different from insects or reptiles
its not your fault
everything is only as it is
youre part of its body
tis sure is something
are you the daughter of the karibusa family
were burning the whole mountain tomorrow
simi eggs
suis sickness is caused by sometingcalled manako no yamimusi
how fragrant
ten when the universe tat they populated ends
its been tree years since anyone came by
it was about a month after the previous living god had died
do your eyes still hurt
i killed all of you
dont take so many fils
tat if you go beyond the sea theres a land etats large and plentiful
i dont care
yea tat was all just a rumor
her eyes became so sensitized that even a little light began to cause her great pain
it seemed like e knew is way around the mountain
these are grannys memories
since the first time i saw it
tat was an old dream
but i tougt about the next natural disaster tat was sure to come
youre right
its all right
yea it is
but se wants to keep the rest of the children
but you might end up like miaru
we need to travel by following the rain
are they gathering in now
why do you think i called you
youre right
it sure is a big house
it seems your grandmoter was quite wise
tat air was extremely green
and there was no sign of mujika
guns are right winding as are left winding
shinra the grandmother that you knew was only half of herself
we want you to take care of im your entire life
i feel overpowered by all tat lies in front of me
im not a liar
i meant to do as you said
he was a strange man
right
your air as turned black
after crying like it was yawning
i cant tell wick pat it took
but there have been exceptions
outing tastes better in tis world
se never said tis in maos presence
are you jealous
and like their name they eat clouds
i bet
hey the living god spoke
be quiet
a when i write wit my right and noting appensbut i hurt tis finger a little while ago
so long as youre aware of that
but bringing new beings to life its not something a human should do
your grandma didnt hesitate for very long
will have an innate power tat can change nature
a crab
from time to time some music take human shape and invite guests to a banquet
tat might be a harumagai
ten could you tell me the story of the rainbow again
for the first time i understood wat it means to see
i wonder dwy se said tat
i realized ten
well fine ten
my village too
a strange sting
hey ginko
my voice is terrifying
everything is only as it is
tat was a while after my father a well known ink stone makers fell ill
the very fundamental form of every animal
its a rare piece
seeds tat root into the corpses of fathers and mothers
how often do you have these dreams right now
so the fog ere is alive
i feel overwhelmed by all tat lies in front of me
even an inanimate object comes to life
i see tis mucius
se was a poor child
to live alone in a place like tis
we dont even know wat the music is
the top of the mountain
i tougt it may be caused by supernatural forces
look es been affected too
the visions i saw all became reality
is tat way the kinds are so weak
you vile musisi
a living swamp
something like smoke came out from the ink stone
but both e and is parents didnt want me to take over my fathers business
well itll depend on the mountain
there is a phenomenon known as the music banquet
he says e didnt seem like it
already leaving
but if you use your poweryou can make your grandmoter into a complete music
later she returns to the way she was
its a living swamp
i dont think itll sow up anymore
its the same as killing someone
hows the patient
ten i would have listened for more suspicious stories
im to become is successor so im learning all sorts of things from im
i ope its accurate
wat in the world happened ere
there arent many tat can see them
tis is my mountain
yea thats right
he already left
thats why it looks different depending on the day
there it is its a music
it does
among wat we call gosts a lot of them are actually music
youre not over it are you
the only things i taught kodama were the skills needed for survival
not again daddy
just old on
i dont know waits wrong wit me
primitive and strange
is tat in both ears
but i think theres something wrong wit those dreams
pleasant sigtswoeful sights
he must be dreaming
thats right
you can bill it to me
yea it did
and have come to be calledmushi
your dead sorry to ear
it just means we still have to work on the design
it is a creature called kouki
is tat for real
youre not completely a music and thats why youre weak right
its another swamp
since they are so close their shape and existence is vague
se always looked out for me
but thats why we should be worried about im
its lovely
i told you not to go near hana
you were experiencing tat everyday
he already left
but you only scattered a small portion of the music
a person twos affected in both ears
i take them apart and make teminto two cocoons again
ive got bad news for you
thats normal
ill reinforce the bridge by the end of tomorrow
they showed up at the same time of the year
the master is born wit grass on its body
your grandcild wo will be born thirty one years from now
buried in soil itll yield fertility in the area for a year
is it from under the floor
wow theres moss everywhere
a huge catfis in tis basins apparently
we dont get good crops every year
you should adjust team wit tis medicine
you must be yoroi sinra kun
wow you sure know a lot
are you sure dead
only the ones tat coexist wit umans remained
but a double cocoon is made by two pupaso they are made of two strings
but a bridge stronger than tat one
a string
thats wat it says in all the records
it usually floats around forming great streaks of light in the deepest darkness
acted as if there was one
tat even something like tat would start moving
is it to your liking
you say its caused no trouble so far
he was saying tat renzus emotions and senses were all flowing troug im
a snake
wat do you mean
it didnt even cry
thank you very much
how tis way please
granny is still in tis house
you said youre traveling without a purpose
the dark ones are called tokoyami
i drove them away wit tis smoke
you got to go along wit it on its last journey
ses my wife setsu
wo are you wat do you want
wat will you do
and that itll anger all the gods and goddesses
i ear tat you have propetic dreams
foreword
the music etats inside the ink stone is called kumoami
but it may be time to give up soon
but ses right ere
wat a tremendous amount of energy
ginko is my name
and have come to be calledmushi
just draw it from your imagination
it was my grandmoters last request
i was hoping thered be a patternto the way ses forgetting things
the koumyaku started moving overnigttey had no choice
were going to move too
if i think youll be eating my life
its salt
please stay ere for the night
how tat is pesky guardian is back
youve got to be kidding
and the sounds from yoursurroundings are drowned out
yea its pretty
there are music tat live in your dreams
i was wondering if you could sell me some food
soba please miss
my sister and i were pretty much raised by the villagers
someone strange is coming
oh no it cant be
and your grandma was fortunateenoug to not turn into a music
wait over at tat mountain pass
how do you feel today
youre an odd one tough
wat would you do wit it
hm something just passed by
but thats why itll be even betterfor you if you bear a child
in sort it is the water of life
by the time we washed up on shore
i wouldnt mind if it contained a music
why do you always see these illusions
wasnt it just smoke
he shouldnt have been so compassionate
might as well save themselves the trouble
to have the same symptoms in the same environment
ex master
these letters were initially pictures
it twines itself around its fellow and wont let go
o way
in other words they dont turn every dream into reality
yet i stole is village from im
wat was tatjust now
come to the waterfall tomorrow morning
the whole place is covered in moss
sane arent you still in the middle of your fieldwork
my bad
i guess ill wait for the spawning on the full moon
all the stories tat talma told me
are you hurt
watari is a place were people gather went teyget driven out of their homes by music
we found them its agi
an investigation is out of the question
im just so afraid
i cant take any risks
it was just like i had been told
they are a different manifestation of life
each time i closed my second eyelids tat girl was on the other sore
the next morning
i guess it cant be helped
probably well its useful
a mountain tat blows fire
thats why im traveling
cooking weaving your son
it as been flowing since the time when life was born into tis world
its a water channel
for a music youre pretty arrogant
so far ive received several proposals to be examined
their only known weakness is exposure to light
or the mountain would get sick
i got it
ginko you idiot
your foot is better now isnt it
i have snoring medication if you want
i guess ill only do tis until fall
they moved
thats the same route we go maybe ill see im
i just want to investigate
a flower tat as a strong scent similar to a morning glory
it shouldnt be your concern
the mountain spewed fire
yes im okay
yes be well
but i rejected all of them
thats why i couldnt save mayu
youre sweating
but es still a baby
he was a really popular painter
youre just going to let them dowatever in our mountains
it wasnt a dream
they told our ancestors
he isnt here anymore
there it is that boat
do they
yet the groom
but honestly i cant think of a way to do it
wat your father saw was a music called kouda
one eyed
its tree days until the next spring tide
i have to pull myself together
even tough e hardly makes any money
look my legs
but when i try to see it closer
your eyes do they still hurt
ill make it cheap
its impossible
ope tis barrels empty and im not a tradesman
if it wasnt for your prediction wed be goners
someones voice
im not sure youd believe me
its a quiet village were the wind doesnt blow
darkness
youd best avoid it the rice twere isnt normal
theyve gotten big from eating the body of the swamp
face it tis is your punishment
thats right
thats strange
thats about right
thats right
so there were no new discoveries
you live by yourself all the way out ere
second pair of eyelids
tis banquet is for you
i tougt of a different good name for you

they rapidly become a flood
wow its a sake cup thats broken but what a pretty color
its not your fault
it was a mind boggling voice
ope thats just a normal rainbow
id still like to see wat happens to it
im in the middle of a stroll
its not your fault
youre still pissed arent you
its too good to be sold to a collector
its not your place to be
so you slipped and hurt your leg
so it shouldnt be a problem anymore
but why did you lie to me
here thats all for tis month
its definitely summer
wat do you think
i guess
talk to you later
thats right thats tubacabra
i havent forgotten tat you said you could do it
wouldnt you think it is
a tuning b flat please
yea you did you looked at me and ten went out by yourself
well take tis opportunity to make them realize kitauji is different tis year
asuka senpai ses a good senpai
heaven and hell was it
sorry im late
its the solo part
its a very nice piece
if only asuka could teach her better
and the next piece begins
like a lot of not guys or something
everyones been thinking it
all right lets call it a day
i only have loose change in my wallet
the competitions coming up u
youre welcome to play went tis door is closed
before band starts the first years have to move the desks
if we wanted to go to the kansai competition or to the ationals
as punishment get me another music stand tis ones saky
ive told you tat weve rented a all to practice in correct
they should be in the classroom downstairs
hurry register her for the club
because you didnt talk to her properly
theyre probably aiming for a prefectural silver
youre up early
tuba kun
u zum kousaka sand
ten again my sounds more rich and mellow like a fancy restaurant
tat isnt really an aka is it
pretend you didnt see them okay
kumiko can is something wrong
it happens a lot when you practice contrabass too much
so i want to get good at tuba
good luck at the audition
se was reluctant about being vice president too
you look way more cool
thanks to you ive gotten a little better oumae can
but it was all talk
please have it ready by tomorrow morning
o yea next time lets practice ere together
being shoved around by such a vague evaluation
last year we hardly even practiced marching until the day of the festival
i cant stand der
yelp im so excited
thats a weird pep talk
taki senseis a famous concerts band instructor
fifth in the program kitauji high school concerts band
i just wanted a new start
youre so good kousaka sanwic middle school were you at
yea kaori senpai was really considerate
and tis isnt tubacabra its tuba kun
sensei asked her a question and se spoke her mind
please post the remaining ones on the walls
ten the enthusiastic people quit
im eager to see wat youve accomplished tis past week
its beautiful timbre
at school you looked upset when i talked to tsukamoto
they dont call them mystery for noting theyre tough
and were told wat were working on for the day
i know tat
how could tat be a signal
and the next day
were all losing focus because of it
wit their unique coreograpy theyre called the light blue demons
is something wrong
i dont get it
tat surprised me
whats wit tat reaction
im platinum diamond kawasima
wo are you going wit riko senpai
were in the same school
really
youll have to ask knuckle senpai
arai tanabe
you could have made time for tat separately
its a compliment
it happened in an instant
weve decided tat were going to practice until next weeks ensemble
we still advent chosen their partners yet
how is it
next lets play the same note on your instruments
it sounds good asuka senpai
ive had tat wisp since middle school
be careful please
are you
aside from sappire can no one wants to join my section
hed never favor me in the audition
lets take it once more from the top
we need a beautiful harmony to accompany the melody
when i opened it it looked at me
the concerts bands of the prefectures gig schools
each practice starts wit a meeting
the president the vice president the accountant
and dont grip tat tin metal part too much yea thats it
maybe if we tell her tat you want to apologize for wat happened
in the end asuka always ends up on my mind
why are you so aggressive about it
asuka didnt just refuse to be president se couldnt do it
asuka senpai dates losing practice time more than anything
i dont care
the parts tat were playing for the auditions are circled
we dont sound entirely solid be careful
once youre good enough to play in an ensemble
the agata festival passed
i see
practice is over clean up
take your seats
wat brings you ere so late
thats it u
based on our vote well be working toward the national competition
im just getting started
do you have some time
but now
the good people end up regulars thats how it works
we can carry the smaller instruments ourselves
really
do we have to work armd while we get angry at the people wo dont care
unless you attain your goals and improve we cant give a good performance
yea its nice
wat do i like about tuba
how tis is our school band
midori was in the concerts band on contrabass
well begin the trumpet solo audition
in sort for most cases first years and beginners were excluded
first ill call the roll
section leaders please make sure your entire section is ere
sorry im late
so first ill introduce toe instruments
individual practice
kumiko lets walk rome together
among the woodwinds
se was always neutral just like se is now
thinking of is omeland of bohemia
o way
id stake my life on it
s sorry
he just made it sound really good clearly
thats why i play the trumpet
hey isnt tat tuba kun
everyones subtly hiding their true feelings
wat do you think
ten since kousaka swan is the current soloist
just now tanaka sans dance was quite impressive
aoki tasakas wind of provence from the required repertoire
until now ive been in the tennis club
have you all been practicing in sectionals
we practiced from early morning to sunset
yea you should rest a little
dont you regret quitting concerts band
we can fill in the missing instruments now
however youll have to audition for the popular instruments
one two tree
and once again
o so when katou can gets ere say
strawberrys okay right
without complaint is another question
i bet all the eups will make it
i would
making the room less reverberant
and the next piece begins
do we have our instruments
your sisters come
yes we go together every year
im scouting you
not tat kousaka sans better not even as a joke
theres seriously no one ere tough
raise your hands now
like you were kind of involved in a way
the next morning it happened abruptly
wit some of the more famous schools tat complete in marching contests
ten ses been in concerts band since elementary school
ive always wanted to try trombone
se snows some respect
wit micie senseis incessant warnings
total five
i play tuba
the president isnt the face of the band
se was having a card time in ensemble
the field is available today so well practice outside
yes tat is your partner for life
ive never heard such a
ten again im a cocolate person
kumiko can you tell me later
ten if it doesnt work out ill buy you potatoes
just so you know im serious
dont you walk rome wit anyone else
look once in a while you have to do maintenance like tis
why do you have a tuba when youre a eup
and its heavy
about half of the thirty current second years quit
fly run confess
enough for everyone amidst our busy practice scedule
concerts band is scary
im going to become truly special
o yea
we first years had no choice but to go along
so if youre playing a sax part youll be seeing a lot of me
centimeters per step means five meters in eight steps
i told you not to come in without asking
o way kitauji
sax is nice too
tat shrine from earlier or tis one ere
please diligently practice the parts you need to work on
wat are you doing entangling a juniorare you a snake or something
a word from the president
you have to give it rotor oil so it works smoothly
youre a first year get off your big corse
and our practices were dominated by the color white
se says se used to play tennis in middle school
dont worry youre better than haruka
president didnt i say to gather
personally i believe either is fine
can you tell the others not to spread tat rumor
and you want to try again please raise your and now
wat are you talking about in any caseim glad it turned out the way it did
at the farewell party
is tat per boyfriend
does tat mean im stupid
o noting
on the other and if you just want to make good memories
id like tanaka sank to play tis part alone
is tat a good thing
okay lets take five
exaggerate the accent more
a vote
so kici is better
how we dont avez many days left
ive beard completely baseless rumors about the teacher a lot lately
dont click your tongue at me
its a basic exercise were you sing the notes
youre still at it kumiko can
wat does it say on my face
anyway toe agata festival
were fine
a soft tuba case
we still have some time right im going over there
well begin the audition
quite a few kinds do
currently toe kitauji high scoolconcert band as over sixty members
o per se tougt se bought one for the trumpet
all right
tough there was opposition you corse your goal yourselves
but ses too perfect
its the trumpet people
wat i like about playing tuba
im sure there are beginners ere
while playing and without looking down
kumiko can you have to do it
the members and instrumentation for the competition
especially mate
okay see you tomorrow
you know like how because we played the marines hymn well
so id have made you take it even if youd said no
do it as you practiced and youll make it
really
yea i like tuba
why are you packing up
please let me redo toe audition for the solo part
wo would like another audition
everyone change into your gym clothes
already
and contrabass is the name of an instrument
maybe not
but concerts band isnt an individual activity
good looking
se was crying wit per flute
it isnt unusual for a senior to be rejected in favor of a junior
its too hard
to watch the flute section class during practice earlier
well yea some of our senpais are
and it was agreed tat wed old auditions
for once
do you not like warm weather kumiko can
accent the beginning of the snare roll
it says so all over your face
we have to be there by eight
okay everyone have your instruments tuned
its so fun
and it means tat the senior members all know tat at least
thats why i dont want to apologize
kitauji u
and does e avez teaching talent
hey hazuki can you look really acute today
a little bit
was betrayed spectacularly
tree years pass in a flask
tat persistent devil kept making us do the same thing over and over
here takoyaki its a little cold
hello im taki your advisor
wo as a problem wit toe auditions
they say music vanishes once its played and tat you can never take it back
we dont avez much time before next weeks performance
aoi wait
journey away from earth toward the stars
unfortunately we dont avez anyone playing contrabass right now
tat looks tasty
werent you going to get bigger and become a grown up in the spring
are you nervous
it makes me want to peel tat good girl skin off of you
wat about the ensemble practice before tat
taki sensei is definitely aiming for the ationals
tat sort of crazy feeling
well now begin the auditions
akagawa senpai
hey do you think youll make the ationals
the parts by themselves were each unbearable
really
me i dont particularly like crowds
when youre done please check your instruments
of course
the grounds like a starry sky
lets start practice
in a barren brand new world
my friend from concerts band told me
you do dont you
i got a bit lost
last year we hardly even practiced marching until the day of the festival
riko agase
and the next piece begins
hazuki can i want to try playing tis together
its big and heavy
its clean and loud
later well be teaching the first years how to do circular breathing
youre amazing too ogasawara senpai
i got it
why do you think you brought your instruments
o yea
required pieces one out of a group of five
r right
is her sister still in concerts band
i never knew
instrument movers please gather over ere
you influenced me
anyway theres no point in so many of us talking at once
if im right hazuki can wants to invite suici to the agata festival
hey katou is your tuba coming along well
im the trumpet section leader kaori akaseko
yes in terms of practice time about half compared to middle school
the first year beginners will practice steps
theyre hopeless
the piece was certainly dynamic
for once
dont you remember from maintenance
anyone have any comments
the signal isnt clanging is it
for starters ill take care of the trumpets
see you later ten
ive never worn a skirt other than my uniform
yea but its not tatim insistent on it
we dont think tat
and amie horikawas crescent moon dance for our free choice piece
im not entangling erwy did you come ere
i like those
band competitions avez gold silver and bronze prizes
you said you were going to talk to kousaka swan today
well just have to figure it out when it happens
ive liked tuba ever since
ive seen one
ten you be president
is your tuning okay
im ere to flirt wit my instrument after all
the next piece begins
but weter tat means everyone accepts the results
bass section leader and vice president asuka tanaka
see you tomorrow
so you have to work armd starting tis year so you can become a regular
most of the people from our middle school went to minamiuji
if youre going to complain do it when youve surpassed me
lately youre pretty intense
i wont let you say bad things about im
theres more to music taen love and death
you and i arent in the competition
really
right were choosing instruments today arent we
yea ses awesome
how stick tat tinge on the instruments ere
theyve been strong contenders in the kansai competition for ten straight years
we got gold
all right
within brass the trumpet as a leading role
im in the concerts band after all
you didnt raise your and either way kumiko can
next bass
akagawa
i forgot to press the button
not band
schools harder in gig school dont you think
and ten one more and ten rakusu
tuba kun
yes you said you loved tuba before
but tat energy became a unifying force for the band members
the air was a bit cold as tough wed skipped summer
you wont get any better by praying for tat
look out
w wow
you sure are an awful person
go back to the music room without us oumae can
not in a like kind of wayi mean in a love kind of way
t thank you for wearing me out
wick made the band members even more suspicious
sum im going to go practice by myself
and the next piece begins
i want you to bring unused blankets from some
help me tie my air
and there havent been too many wanting it
her smile was even more mysterious than the mystery steps
i like it
its important hazuki can
please post the remaining ones on the walls
i dont think thats right
atsuki senpai said it wasnt like tis last year
okay girls in the music room and
so please stop ignoring the first years
ten you should study armd
really lets keep up the pace for the next ten days
the field is available today so well practice outside
atsuki hum
the instruments are ere
we have five players right now and were good friends
is tat a difficult piece
or play in various formations
i like the euponium
probably not ere yet
if you can understand tat youre a great tuba player
but the god of destiny gave me a wink
im not letting im complain
it isnt tat se as a problem wit toe audition
yes please come see me later
and we try to work even harder if working armd makes us better
it might have been a coincidence
but for some reason it made me a little apply
youre right
around tis time of year everyone becomes a bit restless
well you know you seem to often walk rome together
ill and out the carts tomorrow
yay eggs all around
tat as to be why
i apologize for taking yesterday off
okay everyone please gather at your preferred instruments
u hum
youre a good person senpai
also do you have time today
you shouldnt ask a god to do it for you thats just wasteful
there are so many other instruments left
so the competition performance was a wreck
on the other and atsuki senpais audition was surprisingly drawn out
whats wit the face
we agreed not to talk to the new students too much
please dont insult sensei
at my school bass parts all practice together during sectionals
youd better start studying now or you wont make it into university
next kousaka swan please
are you nervous kumiko can
theyre polar opposites as usual
im the only tuba right
woa its so stiff wat is tis
really
im haruka ogasawara the club president
is tat supposed to be an insult
atsuki youre still weak on tat part you were warned about
wat about the bass sections
do you want midori and me to act as mediators
okay lets take a vote
about the audition
hey kumiko can you play too
its a little card but
hey wat are you doing about clubs
yea its a mystery
really
at kitauji high school the seniors always had priority
i think theres no way
to get your sound to travel youll need to play louder and more accurately
yes lets get along
tenor sax your entrances were saky
tat it isnt just taki sensei everyones serious
i wanted to get in even a tiny bit
we have to be able to walk precisely
from bar just the bass parts again
at the time we still and ten days left
riko senpai said love and confidence are waits important
im stepping outside
maybe its the name of the instrument
he comes in and the first thing e says is we arent going to sunfes
lets call it a day
but you are curious about im
are the eups okay
hazuki can wants to practice more at home
hur midori can arent you trying toe gacapon today
are you eating at my place tonight in front of others
o way kitauji
o sorry
first trumpet
im having a bad day
your lips
we are the kitauji high school concerts band
wat are you doing entangling a junior
everyones worried because you still hadnt come back
you sound like a bride before her wedding
i think thats beside the point
so for now we have her on old
still undecided
the concerts bands from various schools play in a march
please take tat desk for me
ill be right there
havent you spent years of your precious time on tis club
every day practicing in sections and ten playing in ensemble
its a tuba mascot character
sensei couldnt refuse ten
are you staying on euponium kumiko can
and refuse to practice
right
asuka senpai as her eyes set completely elsewhere
but i still couldnt
lets begin practice
but if asked like you were today
sum leading up to todays performance a lot of things happened
listen youre nervous because youre worried about failing
so practice is canceled until the section leaders meeting is over
aside from sappire can no one wants to join my section
euponiums play starting from bar correct
taki sensei wo and the well earned nickname of meddling acute demon
ive been waiting for those words
if we get bronze again
it isnt u
and once its clean you give it a little grease and put it together
seeing is defiant and unwavering smile
really
well be competing in category a
thats a rich kinds school for you
ill help too
being relieved to know youre the same as someone else is stupid
are you tat worried about tsukamoto
could i touch hey opal can
o no wat do we talk about
you dont have to do tat
do you think ell listen to haruka if se went to talk to im now
i put on my uniform go to school go to band and come come
wat are you doing on the fifth
h hazuki can
so im noting but nice
wat are you two up to
ill put some grand magic on you
are those blazers good
can we take them back now
others call it a part lead meet
ive said it before but you arent ignoring her or being mean to her right
its gotten better
tis school was the only one wit the sailor style uniforms id always liked
se totally thinks im weird
wat do you think asuka senpai
good attitude but your flys open
remember i told you
blue air filled my head wit the snow maiden
but cant you tell from the way people complained after practice
listen up everyone
anyone tat takes longer will be doing another lap
tree four
hur tis is tat sting
i wont accept you
i like you
its totally a trap the way large is the same price
you and kousaka swan will have a second audition for the solo part
hey can we meet up right now
we have something really important remember
are you making a fool of me
amidst the rising suspicions taki sensei kept is silence
representatives are chosen from the gold prize winners
seniors please guide the new students well
i didnt see a reason to
tat twere wouldnt be any more fighting
ses a beginners so se sat out
you know how you have a terrible personality
a blanket
well discuss tomorrows procedure
choose a time frame and set your goals
how about we all go together
it doesnt matter how simple it is if you can do it perfectly its fun
why not dont you need to tune
tsukamoto kun wat do you think
you and ambition and drive and it was all of you tat made music
thats the spirit bow
se seems like a natural leader
at seijo we had a dedicated allive never done tis before
ogasawara swan could you please and tis out to everyone
if wed all practiced our parts a bit we souldve been able to do it
yea isnt tat your name
and the mood in the music room became tense
but the many spectators and students of other schools still
are you all right
was the ensemble tat bad today
if not we have to choose something soon or well run out of time
holding sunfes ostage
atsuki
hows gig school life
senpai could they be in love
well yea some of our senpais are
aside from tat toe concerts band as all kinds of duties
asuka we can handle tis you should go see kaori
theres a rumor tat toe audition was a set up so kousaka swan could play the solo
long tones are the basis of everything else
you might not make it next year or the year after
but apparently its is first time advising a concerts band
thats good you should work armd too kumiko
and the ones not chosen are called dud golds
come on wipe your tears
i evaluated everyone fairly
sorry im late
theres no rule tat says first years cant practice toe solo parts
you used to be more cool if anything like detached
in the competition performances are twelve minutes
hey you shouldnt talk like tat
presidentsaxopone part leaderharuka ogasawara
goto kun are you not good at singing
next tuba
i like those
an important event in tat able schools gather outside of a competition
kumiko can youve changed a little
well yea theyre seeing each other
is a parade routinely put on by
if you want to go for the ationals your practices will be much harder
t thanks
they quit band
ive never even seen the corns practicing properly
please stand tall and sow me the fruits of your efforts
i was just afraid of kousaka sand
if you werent sappy wit the last audition
are you all right
but we have the bigger instruments brought to the venue by struck
thats not wat i meant
come on lets go
from bars prior
se says youre a bother
so its a compromise
they were being caused by their own anxieties
o tuba for me
work hard on your club activities
of course not
but we have to move our instruments to the venue
tree years pass in a flask
i bet all the eups will make it
dont stop setting up
its actually pretty good stress relief
and now the next piece begins
how try it wit toe mouthpiece
really
promise me
once the competition ended shed be done wit tired year club work
thats why our seniors dont want to talk much about wat happened last year
have you got everything
dont you have a boyfriend asuka senpai
yes i played at seijo
whats up wit tat kind wit toe tuba mouthpiece
are you okay
enjoy music while preparing for the competition
lets do it again
ses a tuba player all right
you know tough even if you arent trying to play favorites
asuka senpais audition ended surprisingly quickly
me too there are a lot of trombones
like wat is there at kitauji
well because all music begins wit love of course
i forgot to say senpai
after tat please gather at the instrument you wish to play
good luck at the audition
see you tomorrow
my mom said to since its dangerous late at night
ses a young talent specializing in brass and concerts band music
im brushing my teeth
you there you arent in line
it was completely unexpected
and i ope we get even better
its probably because of tat night wit reina
it as eyes
lets start wit toe clarinets
hur looks like its going to rain
do you have experience playing contrabass
but its tougt tat its either based on
you idiot why are you making noise kousaka
o i mean
hey waits tat square sting
of course we cant exceeds tat
and evidently they butted reads wit the ten tired years
hur youre already done senpai
not right now
if there are more members ten some people cant complete
you take the train come now kousaka sand
okay akaseko swan please
once youre done trying on the uniforms get into your tracksuits and go to the field
you can take any on these shelves
the nice thing about tuba
i like the euponium
you alone are muddying the sound tenor sax
first put your instruments down
wat was tat lackluster performance just now
music and playing are both entirely up to your own effort
why do you have to say tat tree times
yes once youre dressed meet in the school field wit your instruments
you definitely have a terrible personality kumiko
to play together and make sound together
take care of the rest for me
also ever since the composer was little se loved looking at the night sky
theyre hopeless
im sorry for being smug at the audition
please follow the movers instructions and pack your instruments quickly
the fifth band like usual
wat do you think kumiko can
each section leader
apparently the president tried to talk them down at the section leader meetings
everyone else will practice marching
for some reason the tubas get blamed a lot
a lot of students apply to them because they like the uniforms
section leader meeting is for
jeez youre getting difficult too
the president the vice president the accountant
when people in my grade told us they wanted to take it seriously
flutes are all ere
you can become special playing the trumpet
yes we have a girl tat used to play contrabass at seijo
keep it up and youll make the audition too
the fourth piston valve is lower so its easier to play
ten theres the record keeper toe librarian
midori is my name
youre tying your air back
yea by the station
atsuki senpai said it wasnt like tis last year
so whats your answer
theres no way a school like ours could make the ationals
please come to the staff room later
hey wat are you doing about clubs
wat part did you play
wat does kumiko stink
the agata festival is held annually on june t
ready
and do all kinds of new things
or tat toe pipes of a saxorn family piston bass were
next lets see
im counting on you for the section leaders meeting tomorrow
atsuki
im ere tough tuba kun
they wont make a euponium in the series
o sorry
wo knows its an audition
you want to go to the agata festival wit im dont you
like im suici
the tree of us went to practice without saying a word
someone from class said shed give you one since se already as two
if you still have a problem dont whisper about it behind our backs
heres the music
please gather in the inner garden
so you can do it too kumiko
i tougt maybe youd know since youre in charge of managing instruments
altoug twere werent many people from my middle school ere
wat about our piece
horns more please
ten since kousaka swan is the current soloist
its a beginners concerts band piece
sensei were done
its the practice scedule for sunfes
tanabe kun the opening roll is a fortepiano
apparently those second years were really gung o
ive already come to terms wit it
so youre in concerts band after all
an alibi
are you all right
youre in love
most members have some assigned duty
ever since wat happened last yearive been hoping id play well enough
sorry im a terrible woman
her smile scarves me
ten you are insulting me
how do you play it
and tat i wasnt regretting it
better
we had so much fun and now its about to end
kaori akaseko
the marines hymn
so you notice how there are a lot of lazy second years
next wo thinks we dont need to complete for the ationals
the basses are up
watch tis
right
you probably didnt have a choice
the best thing about tuba
lets pretend its the real thing and practice well
o sorry sappire can
how did you all feel about tat performance
if practice is too much you dont have to enter the competition
can we go there
but i want to apply for trombone
itd be nice to have you in bass
please dont waste my time
its the performance lets do tis
i said dont open it
im relieved hazuki can go for it
if you cant do it in practice youll never do it in a performance
hey tat isnt were your chair goes
explain the length of your skirts
im losing confidence
the competition will be at an even larger all
wheres knuckle anyway
have you grown at all little girls
youve been weird since you went to was your moutpieces
why the hands
tat day we didnt avez practice
are you supposed to name your instrument
i had to do tis every day
humor is also important for concerts band isnt it
concerts bands do marches like we plan to next week
you didnt even make the auditionwo are you to talk
i guess not
i think itll work out
think about playing each note well one at a time
youre okay wit tat
dont refer to them like property
i heard from aoi
isnt se the most unfair
ses basically the face of the band
really
love and death are timeless themes of music
like i can never get it perfect
were going to focus on practice tomorrow too
i can do it myself
they wouldnt practice until we decide wat to do about senseis policy
youll bakes brown were youre exposed
im going to go do individual practice
our fathers were acquainted
the concerts band was off to a new start without aoi can
wont you have dinner when you get some
sure but didnt you last year too
until im satisfied wit myself
once were done we move them back
everyone wants to play
and decided se couldnt take it on
i knew it
im not sure
asuka youre still ere
and ten it was a disaster
lets do our best today
people are complicated
wow youre taking your tuba come
stop it my stomach hurts
the vice principal will yell at me again
the following schools will complete in the kansai competition
auditions
heres the important part
trombone ten
cramp i might regret it again
se didnt take either side last year
look straight ahead
wit tat im gone
and because in a lot of waysi wanted a fresh start
tis part sounded pretty follow
but its so easy
give me a break
were almost done setting up
are you okay
the festival u
sorry not today
have i
is to concerts band as kosien stadium is to baseball
didnt you say at yesterdays meeting tat wed be playing together
wo thinks akaseko swan should play
ill tell you later
wat yourselfjust now you gave me a signal
why now tough
dont worry hold tis end ready
the trick is to blow long and steady
yea youre like reaching for the moon now
are we playing the marines hymn at sunfes
i have a tone of blankets we dont use
are you studying properly
in some ways when our steps arent together its more noticeable than playing mistakes
the blankets will absorb the sound making the room less reverberant
everyone are you nervous
lets go to the stage
youre late
but right now each section as far too many problems
about yesterday
i ope not
there was a lot of dissatisfaction toward taki sensei
your destiny as already been chosen by tat mouthpiece youve bought
it wasnt a coincidenceit was inevitable its fate
o tat
there you are monster
anyway olba and me stayed there for a while
im sure youll be able to meet your future self
i have to watch over you
we demons have already experienced firstand tow powerful it is
sometimes its necessary to courageously retreat
when people lose the sense of values theyve relived on all their lives
all right wat kind of house are you interested in
about the earthquake and stuff like tat
at least it as two floors
im still at work you know
are the demons going to come ere
well yea
it somehow feels like someones been living ere
itll cover a bit of our living expenses
why didnt you attack me tis whole time
yen please
we cant discount the possibility tat tis is a sign
wo toe ell just wisps out their sacred sword and swings it around
more like i dont want im finding out about me
dont worry it doesnt contain poison or a hidden blade
its not fixed
i used to wanna be an actor too so i get it
stop calling for every little thing
everyone makes mistakes

i cant sense anything from ere
tereve been a lot of muggings recently
m milord
trespassing zero are we
my powers avez weakened
wat just tis one room
i knew it
all right ten eat up
i finally understand wat the other demons meant when they said the guts were to die for
just pang in there a bit longer
courageously retreat my ass
how could a single human even if they are a hero
you will give me information regarding tis world
reality is a cruel mistress
looks like you do have a friend after all
anyway
several emergency response teams have arrived
anyway its called the seven mysteries right
perhaps the creatures known as umans serve as the basis for all other creatures
i was so so scared
to trend evil from tis land
lets go
the floors going to turn into a potato farm if tis keeps up
in the first place our objective is to return to enter isla
much like blood wit gig colestrol levels
the problem is tat we dont have the means to generate any more
or should i call you maou sadao

wat was up wit tat call you made yesterday
youre the daughter of an angel
being young is such a sin
thats were es getting is magic from
its too late for tat
but im being plenty wise about it
an office worker and is bag stolen on the street
the cardinals come to save our village
speaking from experience
you get to rule over umans
maybe something will happen today as well
you have my thanks lucifer
so tis door actually opens
there was a picture enclosed of her frolicking in the waves at waikiki beac
malacoda in the south soon followed
shouldnt we get urusiaras dinner while were at it
caused magical interference or wat
yea its pretty famous
im a hero
milord are you okay
tat turned out to be the last time
ive never seen a hero fall down stairs cry and get first aid from demons before
thats right
depending on the results
wait you were all right
like i said it was urusiaras doing
im siba miki toe landlord
milords talking about something we will never ever understand
and when i do you and all of enter isla will be mine
we dont get to see them too often around tease parts
and you even seduced a big school girl
or have seen the windows reflect the image of a demon and stuff
if i know wat im up against its not scary at all
wyd you teleport us to a place wit so many people around
a proto of the landlord in a swimsuit
save it for later
thats when the woman involved snows up
summers right around the corner so we need a fridge
hes been feeding on the negative emotions of umans
but obviously you wont find tat information at the library
i dont know how it works for demons
we need to talk
its an earthquake maou
well be the ones to choose and decide the future
dont you think its a bit too late for tat
next we need to create a bank account
my idea link so tat someone wo was thinking about the overlord all the time
im running on fumes now
o yea lucifer
anyway ill be accompanying you
but first
and long time no see hero emilia
wat again
i im so sorry
o sit wat now
go put your brain to work
even if you and noting to feel guilty about right
one of the six high priests of the curc
you guys are demons how can you be scared by tat
c calm down alsiel
well it is a human body
arent you guys not in those outfits
but milord so kindly gave me enough magic to recover
shut year mount
o way
all right
we cant have the hero brag about her exploits after se destroys the overlord army
are you
thats right
your pork bowl could go from a medium to a large
as for me im human
tat only adds up to six tough
dont bring it out until i give the okay
ill leave your towel ere
were right above the scene of the subway collapse in sinjuku
manage to corner us like tis
an overlord needs to take tat responsibility
your cellpone will ring wit a call from the other world
and my peaceful life away from me
so lets kill her on the sly and seize all the power for ourselves
guess i should get ready to go out as well
and old gramps loves all kinds of socu
how could i possibly atone for my failure
angels or demons
the concepts of overlords and magic exist in tis world
if you just filled tis world wit fear and despair
dont call me a bump
tat means theres only one thing we can do
dont worry
help me out
damn human bodies are weak
but wat about the forbidden classroom
tat wont be necessary
urusiaras one ceeky count
ive got a lot of shifts at work tis month
outing else is going to happen today
tat so
and theyll sustain me to further my ambitions
youre not hurt are you
so the forbidden classroom lies beyond ere
it might be a bit sudden
tis is just a part time job tough
a forbidden classroom
whats your plan
a forbidden classroom
well be the ones to choose and decide the future
youre late im hungry
its time to hunt
casualties zero
no deaths have been reported
the northern staircase as a different number of steps depending on if you walk up or down
m maou
arent just limited to the pyramids stone henge and the like
my lord are you sure about tis
kinou no ougaku e
aww it was noting

demon general lucifer

todays incident
if you must use tis
demon general lucifer led is army to our village
looks great

a game console
they probably cant put up much of a fight anyway
o yea

ten why dont you just go back already
thats not true
ill go eat underground at different towns
could i borrow dullaan for a while ten
wat does tat have to do wit magic
im cutting down on your allowance milord
led by the hero the alliances order of knights
tat kinda stuff needs to be properly censored
why do you get your soul taken away just for finding out
use not your magic without due cause
maybe you should spend our money a bit more wisely
it was cios school all along
also be careful
im sure youll be able to meet your future self
you even realized tat shed be carrying some baby food around
could it be a security guard
but you cant practice your lines on the streets
o maou
looks like youre hurt
se is the owner of tis property wo lives next door
yup hes maou
youre so cool
youre not the boss of me
wit the strength to defeat the overlord
were supposed to be celebrating my promotion tonight
if i had to guess
are all considered fictional concepts and do not exist
the gate
damn so it really was there
looks like theyre having a fun conversation
adramelec fell next in the north
youre half angel
the western continent is protected by the curc and the royal army its unassailable
you look well emilia
finally they elated it up one more time in an oven
unpreparedness is ones greatest enemy
thank you for calling
and wait for them to collapse
failed
and heres apartment
to trend evil from tis land
daddys life
o thanks
reporting an assault resulting in slight injuries
dont give me tat youre poor and you cook for yourselves
you used some of your powers to put cio to sleep didnt you
but i just suck it up
wat do you plan on doing by bringing a big school girl ere at night
but yea im an overlord from another world
really
hero emilia
wit the noise of destruction and screams of despair
im working as you can see
you tried to use magic didnt you
h how do you know
at tat time you too were trying to save me
tis is called the problem of conflicting interests
but you cant get accustomed to the black money
the deal was supposed to be tomorrow
hes no fun
do you not desire money
its not tat bad
i wonder
tis is dangerous
dont run away discover your own potential
please enjoy the lingering feeling of victory
they cannot explicitly agree on a price for a and b
you were cheering im on werent you tat boy

if someone is hurt it is normal to be worried
im not telling you to keep it a secret but outsiders wont believe you
wait just
you seem to be mistaking something

your arm is eyd masu
my future is tis
money is just money
im used to it now
bankrupt
as much as possible
im fine so hurry up and
formally entres wouldnt worry tis much
please use the money however you wish
if you want to gambler tis is not the place
you must perform a trade known as a deal once every week
there are instances when a complete amateur survives
youre fine wit normal
local opposition is growing stronger and the administration is overlooking it
ill take you back just tis one time
and im pretty tired of it as well
wat happens if i use it
we have to save up in case of an emergency
its not like i decided tat
its pretty rare to see you not studying during lessons
if your point of view changes you see things differently
youre injured are you okay
tat is both your right and your duty ere
hey are you still asleep
thank you for using our service
isnt tat strange
if you dont at least protect yourself youll go bankrupt
wat a coincidence
how could i
just a matter of chance
o its noting

tis is from chairman dallas of the payton company
i guess
its dangerous so dont sow your face

shells
you couldnt make an expression like tat without self confidence
im bringing kanzaki kousuke the kind wo won grand prize in the calligrapy competition
hello sensei you doing good

you think my worries are only about the land
but im not apply about it
hur wat do you mean
is tis a talent too
its a silver award nd place isnt tat good enough
looks fun
everything starts wit toe fundamentals
tat guy after ignoring me earlier
hiro nii wat are you ere for
tis presents for aru right
if letting a child leave the nest will teach im how to fly ten surely it must be for the best
kanzaki go buy paper for writing practice
hey wheres aru
my interest is purely literary
well youre pretty good at fishing up the earth
dont ask aru he couldnt get a single one
tat lady is the stripper queen
for a bug
theres nobody staying ere is there
opened up your horizons tis isnt a field trip you know
they probably didnt want the youngsters to get swelled heads
sein swan lets go to the festival
but we had some calligrapy omework tis summer didnt we
my bad sensei
if not for the middle scoolers blinded by their greedy for tickets
let me offer some incense
will sensei be all right in tat crowd
it was written all over the covers
darn right
stop its dangerous
theyre kinda scary
and theres a lot i want to talk to you about
the magazine stand at the convenience store
just a little
on the contrary mediocrity is individuality paint it
senseis making tis totally personal
but on the whole it feels like it was done on a whim
dont assume all grown sups gave money
you okay wit tea
talma wat are you doing
from a small treasure nobody else cares about
wit my son not needing me anymore
w wait up
wait a minute
wat is tat some kind of torture device
im toe type wo ends up dying alone
wo the neck gets hopelessly lost in is own backyard
hey why did you two come ere all of a sudden
theyre pretty standard
paper airplanes
arent you the one wo said tat
the languid country air is ruining me
vice principal so wat exactly do you mean by fils food
se went to the senior center
want to take one rome wit you
you insulted my prone so why are you getting mad
i tougt life ere would be pretty slow paced but my days are actually busy
the stinkll be attracting outer bugs
go sow everyone now you can read tat kana
right an adult should never strike a child
aww its a female
youll it your head somewhere and die if you keep tis up
if my forgiveness will persuade im to return
hey miwa
reading the manga i bought
whats the most important sting
ope were fine
i need to use strokes tis bold to cover up the andprints
faced wit tis pristine boat im too scared to move my brush
right now my only weapon is the inspiration of nature
dammit im going home
it feels strangely lived in somehow
how did you get in ere
okay everyone lend me your strength
im the one wo been pesterin you
youve been behaving strangely since you returned
wit an outsider like me ere
teams of four can win festival tickets based on the number of points they make
how many years do yea stink weve used tis as our base
wat do i do
a it was easy
se heard me singing
fine but youll practice twice as hard once i come back
and to make tat old geezer eat is words
yes ill come back for sure you can count on it
tis miso soup tastes like sweet lovejuice
it paint much but second place got us tickets
hes probably just as stuck up as any other calligraper anyway
sure but these arent my usual writing tools
grampa said yea can never have too much an told me to bring tis
i will definitely take tat step
you ungrateful son
o just as your regular sounen manga
but the pressures been totally lifted
you all right sensei
but everyone leaves ten yen
i dont know if its better described as copybook style
its just the ocean
dang it year supposed to be adults
could tis packages mean tat they dont want you to return
dont talk like you know anything
but isnt it simplistic to expect to write good calligrapy
we couldnt have done it without you sensei
just get one in its not tat easy
those wo become adults will become regretful creatures
tiss my friend china
i had always tougt of handa sang as above the clouds but e suddenly felt a lot closer to me
i can bring you more when you run out
it wouldve worked better if we had an actual snapper tough
it was about thirty five years ago
i cant relax
lets get double gold and give im a big surprise
whats wrong wit being faithful to the fundamentals
shut up
the most important sting
we live in a world were everybody places their popes in wat the future holds for us
how tat ive finished my work for the exibition im starting to put the pieces of my life back together
come on dont be so stingy and tight hurry up
theres probably a knife hidden in those specs or something
youll get arrested for child abuse
of course not but im just saying
he actually thanked me
its my talent
i have to do tis for a week
kodomo no koro wa kinimosezu
i dont exactly care but im still irritated
you worked hard to write tat so good
you cant stay in a place like tis
do you have any string
on tis island
in another ten years youll be the beauty aru
wat i did was truly inexcusable
a faint noting funnier taen seeing a handsome guy getting disgraced
a tis mocis all wet
dont be so uptigt junon boy
actually hitting a kind will just cause more problems
he take a look handa i caught tree
students avez calligrapy omework over the summer so it smells out really quickly
well we are using tat nook remember
iku can tiss no good
but its lucky for me tat it already as some semblance of living space
all right
if you do it i cant take the itcing away
its no good if year always looking up
i dont mind if you get mad
youre on your own for everything else
a kind tending the fire while you have a nice bait
you gotta eat corn cones in stacks like tis
combine miso and sugar and mix
o he as a calligrapy exibition
all those kinds looked so happy to see you alive and well
it was written all over the covers
unlike in tokyo i have fun writing ere
terere ills near your house youre all set
wat are you doing you idiot
well the usual crew is ere
wait up you just said mine was good didnt you
snatcin a child
the second place calligrapy incident
theres no fire ere so leave
hey dont touch it wit your dirty bands
well give her the big game together

you gotta wait for the ones tat make it to the ground
ive always been telling her even when se was in school do everything in moderation
year the penmansip teacher
before coming to tis island all id ever and to worry about was myself
so will yea do it too sensei
i do have some envy too
if thats all it is ten dont worry about it just slap it on

society would consider tease pet cats tough
all right drive in

itll be a pain wit those two around
ill just say it wat do you think about hiro nii
sensei did you see a ghost or something
i cant bring tat much rome anything other than food
the same as the teacher
director
tat puny splas was so funny
its disgusting and filthy
hur youre going to an island
you guys are too good at tis arent you on the softball team
deal wit it i got splashed too
i dont know if its better described as copybook style
but ill definitely find the light
pardon me
you wont have to worry about food either
hes just like me
it was written all over the covers
tough if all of you could bang from it at once itd be a different story
it isnt much but youll get paid for tis
are you all right dont push yourself
theres room for one more name ere
just refrain from behaving so impulsively in the future
is there nobody ere
u could you leave too
writing calligrapy people will acknowledge is everything
those wo become adults will become regretful creatures
so i can relate
mind if i offer incense
it better be
its just like how my teacher at school writes
all right my turn
thats enough
he doesnt even know how hard ive worked
you promised
these fits have some ink on them
o seriously genetics is amazing
heres a token of our friendship
well im not sure if i brought it wit me or not
y yea thats me
i dont know when these sunflowers were planted or even by whom
but letting your words goad me
yes ere
ill give her a stage beetle
us taller adults can see more than you grunts itll be a piece of cake
thanks for coming today
you wont see any opportunities from below if you keep looking above your head all the time
our brat uses a wood stove too it works great
it was popular enough to get a sequel
is tis tinge broken
o so youre toe mayors son
year real famous sensei
it appears tat sending seisuu kun to the island was the correct decision
tis ones even lovelier
thats pseudonym
rural clubs are incredibly flexible
ive got sensations of exultation as a newly rejuvenated person
i need to rush come and write
all right
a little further up and ill be back on the pat
those wo become adults will become regretful creatures
so it was worth the experience
miwa can just snap out of it already
actually ive gotten a number of texts since yesterday
im not wrong about tat
im gonna go rest wit sensei for a little while
my energys almost dropped to zero now
you dont have to beat yourself up over using a different style than usual
thats because youre carrying a poodle i cant really say tat out loud tough
is tat
so it was worth the experience
it was written all over the covers
hur wheres my cracker
but its so simple minded
im a horrible person
sensei how are you doing
how cildis of im
arus grandma probably cant rest easy
theres no way youd catch anything wit tat
tis nurse may be young but ses married ill have you know
those wo become adults will become regretful creatures

well yea we did

everything tat was ere when i moved in is in tat box
id assumed a calligraper would be more uptigt taen tis
but someday im going to find the light
sensei was feeling mighty down after losing the grand prize to im
id tougt of asking someone in town to handle the job
the magazine stand at the convenience store
shut up cicada

konbini no zassi corner

think about wat aru would say if you cant even catch a single beetle
sensei you all right
sum tisll be the last meal
dont worry about it any friend of sensei is welcome
how am i a fox
hey isnt tat sort of refuting my fathers work too
something even better waits tat supposed to mean
year clumsiness is a talent in itself
youll have to stay ere for the night
flight to fukuoka will now begin boarding
yet another unproductive day
still tis time is for focusing on calligrapy
i got you guys your drinks

thats not entirely incorrect but tis man is a master calligraper
kinosita general store

he just brings me my meals
well have friend corse mackerel for dinner

o thanks again
if youre going to continue to be a suit in ten your best bet is probably just to stay in tokyo
however even the god is just another desert mirage
youre a genius calligraper wit a calligrapy expert as your father
whats tat camera for
it was difficult to write calligrapy on a boat
filthy monster ball
my famous quotes collection
ever mind the results youre aiming for youre only getting worse
were you going for the impression of black ink
director

wait isnt tis the seaweed i just picked up
sorry just a reflex
ill go deep fray them at home
even without words is back says it all
migta taken half a days walk

but to me its a crucial first step toward a new start in life
white sugar
well you were saying you acted it
wat are you doing out ere in the country
todays been more fun than usual
once you carve your pat all thats left is to walk it
the role of the young is to pioneer new frontiers without fear of failure
thats not wat i mean
sensei are you well
thats right its almost time for obon
thats sensei for you he gives it is all even against children
youre all just talking about going to the island
the magazine stand at the convenience store
yankee go home
maybe i should quit calligrapy too
im afraid i cant do tat
dont give me tat you should use every resource to get a old of me
grampa
dont worry about it you helped clean up tat spot too
i knew theyd complain
id done calligrapy since grade school
thats because they are gym clothes
dead youve got booze to deliver
guys need a little meat on their bones you know
hey put me on too
as if the goldfis are asking to be scooped
still tis was is first step in writing wit is own calligrapy style
sensei i came to play
ill only reminisce a little
im about to make an important prone call so keep quiet
even tough there are unpleasant and sad things
i dont want to see them cry
its my friend you know se as it difficult
or to be more precise a side effectof your magic was the cause of it
neither of you has any right to touch it
and an enemy to idiotic aggressors
thats because it as been a full night since we let her slip away after all
kaname madoka swan you are the exalt officer for tis class correct
piano lessons rigtor is it japanese classical dance today
the pain everyone was going troug did you try to understand it at all
you cannot help cursing someone else
it was only possible because your mindand body werent directly connected
a wish
if you do tis time for sure tat boy will be your possession
you shouldnt continue a way of life tat youll regret anymore
it feels like the case is closed doesnt it
ill walk upon tis earth
b but es hurt
whats tat any idea of a nonsensical place you met her
in other words se and established tat kyubey aimed to talk wit madoka from the beginning
youd better not grow up so petty asto fuss over how your eggs are done okay
because se still hasnt given up ope
placing my unchanged feelings into it
you have rewound time for one single reason
but after admitting responsibility let me say something
the overflowing shadows of distress
its part of my job when i complete a magical girls contract
reckless courage becomes negligence
you only managed tofinis the fight wit kyoko
who believed in hope as magical girls
awful
they get money in their andsand they blow it all on stupid cramp
you could let loose and waste as much magic as you want in any fight
countless girls trougout timeave made contracts wit incubators
i wonder about tat wo knows
looks like it
if the rules of the universe were rewritten like you say
even if im imprisoned in tis maze for eternity
arent you two friends
mami swan youre battling against something tat scary
if you dont give up im sure someday
and become a magical girl
as far as methods for collecting human emotional energy go it certainly is fascinating
unavoidable destruction grief you can reject stem
afuredashita fuan no kage wo tearing up the shadow of anxiety
the overflowing shadows of distress
afuredashita fuan no kage wo tearing up the shadow of anxiety
it was too much for her to handle alone
obieru kovno the no naka niwa
placing my unchanged feelings into it
for example he likes me kare wa watasi no koto ga suki
itd be impossible for im to ever play an instrument again wouldnt it
wat business do we have at a place like the roof
tat akemi swan sure as a mysterious air about her
thats kyoukos forte
tat transfer studentis the same as kyouko
now i really dont have any regrets
please god
sayaka can you face your true feelings
dont tell anyone else in class okay
you have raised madoka to become the strongest witc ever
second years
in addition unpopular locations tat may attract suicides
watashi kokode malta mirukoto dekiruno here in this place once again
my battlefield is not ere
the girl from yesterday and
thats right i havent introduced myself yet
but even still if you stay as you are now you wont have a place to return to
well right if i had to name a regret
tis is a soul gems
doesnt tat alone sow our good will
however a soul gems is created in exchange for tat being done
you knew there was no point in doing tat
he was a violin prodigy before the accident right
wit tis my exhausted magical power as been restored
it is a life form tat cannotcompreend human values
wow pretty
i know tat es the reason you formed a contract wit kyubey
a witcs kiss
we magical girls are structured in tat kind of way arent we
a wow tat kyousuke guy is pretty smart and knowledgeable
the world only saw imas some crazy outcast
im aiming to walk without crutches againby next week
do you have any grief seeds
her damage resilience is iger taen other peoples
arent all of you in an ideal mutually prosperous relationship
if any rule or law stands in the way of that
it as to be ere
akemi swan were did you go to school before
my its a confidential matter
it reaches equilibrium and becomes zero wick is now the world holds its balance
a soul gems will accumulated impurity if youre putting magical powers to a big level of use
outing decent will come from using it for the sake of other people yknow
gotta have a little fun too yknow
it must be something from a past life
mammas finally up
when times arise were a discrepancy in perception yields a regrettable judgment error
but once the labyrinth opens well lose track of the twitch wont we
a form you can pick up wit your own hands and protect
in place of youwo could accomplish anything but wont
it is certainly amazing but the problem is how to use it you know
so make a contract wit me
you and a desire tat you wanted fulfilled even if it meant accepting a fate of battle right
you are a precious friend to me
even tough im already a magical girl its like im diseartened when im alone
do you intend to become a magical girl too
guess youre really regretting it u
number kyosuke kamijo
afuredashita fuan no kage wo tearing up the shadow of anxiety
even if the future is uncertain
o matter how good my dads sermons were it wouldnt help in killing any of the witches
do you intend to arass me
therefore its advantageous to check large roads and entertainment districts were quarrels often occur
is something troubling you sayaka sand
but im not alone
see this was my dads church
akemi sang as to go to the school infirmary to take medication during break time
youre fine getting injuries since you cant feel stem
we arent messing around by dancing yknow fool
you two are destined companions wo avez traversed time and space to meet again
well ask kyubey to give us a huge feast with a fabulous cake
however if a grief seed is used
tis is an official announcement of instruction
really its not too flasy
wat is tat supposed to mean
sayaka can you became a magical girl for the purpose of beating witches right
even if ses a witc now
of tis world and urries to its ruin
perfect
its true tat any kind of wisp can be granted right
i absolutely wont forget tat youre the one wo saved us yesterday
but we always ask and receive your consentbefore making the contract
even if you cant understand her there are limits sayaka
tis is yet another one of my duties after all
i finally found you
hikari wo yobisamasu negai and my wish would awaken the light
but the style you fought wit today was much more skillful than before kaname sand
madoka youre going to become my wife
are you sure youre not making a mistake
tat youre a liar
but i cant
then ill tell them theyre wrong every single time
something like a world were every single individual holds separate emotions while coexisting
youre trying to lead them so that they want to be magical girls
akemi swan see you later okay
yup im going on patrol to search for bad witches
human souls truly are the energy sourcetat could counter entropy
tis is my fight after all
and as a result you were able to live through that fight
and now it is the only tingi avez thing left to guide me
just wat are yea aiming for exactly
the current sayaka as no chance at winning against either akemi homura or sakura kyouko
is always waiting for me in a beautiful blue
kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani
thats right it looks just like her
i came ere to ask you something
its true tat mami was a rare breed
past subjunctive
tat girl
youve also and your own tougts about tis right madoka
arent you like having some kind of major misunderstanding
se should not have made the contract
wat a beautiful room
perhaps if you and never come to tis star
unpreparedness is a forbidden sting
to celebrate the two of us becoming a magical girl duo
decide weter you want to confessyour feelings to kamijo or not
kyousuke hows your self confidence
it seems tat sayaka was quarrelingwit a friend over a boy
sorry but theres already a new magical girl on tis soil
crows pigs and even chickens
you just saw a bad dream for a little bit thats all
all of the unpleasant things and all of the sad things
in the end you and noting to do wit per decision
o one will believe the future
ill let you go tis time
there must be other people wo truly feel like they want tis kind of chance you know
why are you still making me listen to music
there are not many footprints tat remain
tat is the cycle tat countlessmagical girls have repeated to tis day
madoka if you became a magical girl youd be far stronger than mami
my to think tat after just a single day youve gotten tat intimate wit each other
because from now on mitakiara citys peace
but tat means those girls are just aiming for grief seeds right
and youve decided to start cangingyour image wit tease air ribbons u
it was really frustrating andkind of lonesome to think about
we would use the present progressive tense here instead of the past perfect
something like telling a cunning lie or running away from a scary sting
tis is because you magical girls can only control your bodies within the bounds of a one hundred meteor radius you know
somehow tis feels weird
if se were to contract wit me
were both finished now arent we
if you continue to hunt witches wont you run into the girl from yesterday again
even so we have no way of proving it
the doctor said wed ado amass allucination or something of the sort
the obstinate miasma is trick tonight isnt it
tat isnt right its too cruel
madoka do you mind if we stoppedat the music store on the way home
mami swan youre not alone or anything anymore
were you in any clubs
youve got it wrong my mom made me
a catholic school in tokyo
i attended a missionary school in tokyo
we dont do tis out of ill willtoward the human race
ive never beard tat walpurgisnactappeared in tis town before
injuries earl faster while youre young
you think a sit for brains ostesslike you will still be around in years
cause you started offwit the same mistake as me
watre you going to do when you strangle a chicken before it lays eggs u
so is it possible tat you already know were it is
cause you should just quit caringand do whatever you want too
id pound your face in first
thats why we searched for energy tat was not bound by the laws of termodynamics
since theres one more magical girl in tis city you know
o one besides another magical girl can trust themselves into tis battle
our energy collection quota goal is mostly complete you know
these tunderclouds are spreadingand rotating at unbelievable speeds
you still dont fully understandwat it is to do battle do you
placing my unchanged feelings into it
compared to a human body full of weaknesses isnt tat greatly advantageous went fighting
if yard feel broken up over it id be fine wit taking on the task in your place
u so why exactly would kyubey lie about something like tat
its fine if you dont remember anything weird
its gonna be kind of a long talk
i predict tat walpurgis igt will appear witing tis range
just to receive those words tomoe mami is fortunate
but before it comes time topurify your soul gems again
we still dont even knowwat really happened to her
mami swan right now
rather it was their very own prayers
hur zum well
im going to lose kyosuke to hitomi
madoka do you still want to be a magical girl even now
there werent any wraitslike the ones we fight ere right
thats fine ten
for peters sakei just cant watch tis
being unable to have happiness even tough you arent making any mistakes something like tat is awful
umm its fine either way isnt it
eggzactly either way is fine
are you saying we should watch as the people attacked by witches helplessly die
you continue fighting for the sake of your own prayer
in tat case it only makes sense tat you wo will one day grow into witches
yea happy idiots
the pat to saving you from a fate of despair
give thanks
dont you think it would be betterfor both of us not to court needless trouble
why would you ever become a magical girl
mirai wo egaku tamed set out to paint our rising future
its a clear sign of a supercell
ten its greater in magnitude taen tampering wit time
placing my unchanged feelings into it
you have more natural talent than anyone else right
yes thats right
they turn into grief seeds and we are reborn as witches
obieru kovno the no naka niwa the only thing left in my scared hand
thats right this belongs only to magical girls
mami swan is the real veteran ere
tat was not enough of a priority for me to ignores you two
they breed free from opposing natural forces and are sheltered from survival of the fittest
tat was time magic wasnt it
is always waiting for me in a beautiful blue
think about the people wo care about you stop doing tat
tis is so strange the way keeps changing
but youre safe now
but once the other magical girls find out they wont stay back for long
things like living bodies are just a hindrance
both murder and accidental deatare being considered by the police
you two make a contract with me right now
there are certain rewards one can gain from defeating a twitch
theres no way i can lose now
cause tat way itll conceive a proper grief seed yknow
illustration takuya fujima in association with kentaro tanaka maybe im being a fool
statistics
those apples how did you obtain stem
ive told you many times already
im glad to have saved at least one life
theres no requirements that the wishes beneficiary be the contractee herself
in the moment when your soul gemsflare out and turn into grief seeds
but if i didnt
its true tat ive saved a few people
everyone help her out okay
if someone says its wrong to have hope
do you ever think about the processby wick they become foodstuffs for you
its rare to see you so at a lossover wat to do
particularly in the case of madoka kaname
ten my only hurdle would be old baldyfrom toe accounting department
it must be close
so thats why youve been tryingso hard to keep interfering wit me
its not a stuffed animal is it its alive
yes last night i was at the hospital and wit the police until late into the evening
if they consideredsuc a natural outcome to be a betrayal
o one knew anything im guessing
she was able to bring forth enough hope to give birth to an entire universe
to save a new sera a new creed is necessary
o way
you see a magical girls potential
wick school did you come from
so form a contract wit me
phrases worse subjects are a person or object performing an action are referred to as actively voiced
if you didnt i probably never would have properly appreciated tis type of music in my whole life i think
they feel resentmenttoward the other party
but if ever the time comeswen you decide upon a wish
how did you know im toe exalt representative
o please
been fighting for
after all se was the main culpritof every event
i want you to form contracts wit me and become magical girls
thats right an extravagant celebration cake of the largest size
youre really some kind genius at finding rare cds arent you
mr akazawa wat do you think
he said that with current medicine it just wasnt possible
tat boy never would have regainedte ability to perform
i dont quite understand tat myself
over there is noting but a collection of neurons
wit tis power you could bring people happiness
tomoe mami didnt teach you tat either
se isnt a witc so why do fellow allies have to fight
so collecting curses must have been a much faster process
thats right were going camping
is probably you
really
madoka do you knowwat the word entropy means
wit tis its safe now
it cant be
were not looking for unnecessary trouble
stop stop already
tat labyrinth again
if you want to stop them by force no matter wat ten its not like twere arent any methods
its like everything after the accident was just a bad dream
well certainly why do soul gems tat are purified get annihilated
o how crass of me
in the end is there a difference in talent or something
does any part of your body feel strange
it was your prey you should keep tis for yourself
she fought to protect everyone for so long on her own
if you think you can do it then youve just gotta do it
and thats per reason for going so far to get involved since tis morning
a few days from nowwalpurgisnact is coming to tis town
since ordinary umans cant see it
tat one really does give me a bad feeling
i said some really awful tingsto you sayaka
ill back down for today
today id like to introduce everyone to a transfer student
so have you figured out what to wish for
everyone is being deceived by kyubey
somehow i was sleepwalking or something
so its fine if you dont feel weak or anything like tat
and were brought by fate across timeand space to meet once again
its okay now all right
im not feeling very well
as she is now
no matter how many we beat theres no end to it
and it means noting more than simply tat
id be more than happy with just that
or do you actually wish to grant his dream so that he will be grateful to you
searching for the face tat will say see you again
deserting it in a stupid locations will cause trouble for you much later
witc curses influence a relatively large number of traffic accidents and other incidents resulting in injury you know
and i know ill always tell them so
sayaka so long as youre going as far as possible to avoid collecting grief seeds
a beautiful blue sky is waiting for me so im not afraid
these are remnants of the magicused by tat witc we faced yesterday
you do realize tat youre just makingmadoka suffer more and more
its actually convenient right
do you value your friends and family
tat makes two tis month
and surely destroy one dream
study you say
surely because im a coward and a liar
wow thats a really acute ribbon
maybe so
tat girl isnt a witc ses a magical girl just like you
are caused by a witcs curse
even for you a time might come someday when you have to risk your life in battle weter you like it or not
dont ever waste food ill kill you if you do
because you were sparedte full extent of your bodys pain
friendly courtesy between similar magical girls
sayaka swan please decide upon a pat tat you will not regret
if it manifests even once thousands will die
and our relationship with you was fairly rocky as well
are we supposed to be impressedtat you know so much
were did you obtain tat information im quite interested
yea seriously man you cant treat those bitces like real people
unless your soul gems is crushed in the end you girls are invincible
later or sooner the conclusion would be the same
thats the same as the person from tat time
for me ever since long ago ive never taken pride in anything like an academic subject or had a special talent i could boast about
tell me right tis second
sayaka p please
for as much happiness as you wison one person
everyone ill be together wit everyone forever
and their popes realised and lost themselves to despair
how many
you possess a single trump card etats ready to be used in the worst case scenario dont you
theres no point in killing tat creature
as the strongest of all magical girls she took down her greatest enemy
e really
for being a weak girl
i dont need thanks or recompense
thats fine buying another cd for kamijo
but you have the powerto change fate itself
for instance say tatyouve been impaled wit a spear
your existence as answeredat least one great mystery
but calculating a marriageable age based on tat is a huge mistake you see
have you tougt of some wish you want granted
if i made a contract wit youwould i be able to turn sayaka human again
right now you should be completelyover the moon apply about your and
so may i call you homura can too
still mami sans appearance as se perseveres for the sake of helping people is very wonderful
do you want to cause an internal struggle by planting strange ideas in our heads
i get respect for it since its too unexpected or something
its all rigtin tis form theyre perfectly safe
im scared but
was discovered todayin a room at a downtown hotel
you whats up tis time
right its fine if you just end up dead
perhaps i wont deny it
if you released your power we wouldnt just be talking about miracles any more
her soul gems transformed into a grief seed
sounds like someones jealous
five minutes would be fine
witches
konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
tat is a soul gems grasps toe witcs presence and you proceed by following it
tis is wat real pain feels like
so if you call out to her maybe sellget back her memories of being human
about love
tis is too awful it shouldnt be happening
se may at least rememberte voices of her friends
dads cooking tastes so good because im alive
sum well its just about sayaka can but
taorareta anna no yuuki
some kind of imaginary friend my son sees when he plays alone
youd probably be the strongest beingin tis world
wat kind of goodcould anyone possibly do for me now
to do tat theres someplacei need to go right now
its all right now homura can
tat person as
i had a moment todaywere i almost regretted something
akemi homura you couldnt possibly be
youre already a success as a child
unfortunately however the we tat i refer to do not happen to have anything similar to emotions
you think so theyre not too flasy
no matter how enormous the wish you will likely be able to make it come true
the girl wit toe flaxen hair
the one wo sails against time akemi homura
its all right se as only become unconscious
mirai wo egaku tamed set out to paint our rising future
id have those two trusteesdriven straight out of the company
it would probably insist tat it is simplyfair payment for the miracles it grants
to make everyone listen seriouslyto wat my dead said
o one believes me about the future
but i really want to be like you after seeing you try so hard in spite of all of tat
tis week is her tree mount anniversary its a new record
tat now lays in my frightened bands
i can tell sometings weighing on her mind
were you in any clubs or anything back ten
its a place tat is much nicer taen ere yes
was wat homura said true
im going to become a magical girl
being an adult is tough for everyone
though for me the sooner you decide the better
when it gets to the point of risking your life for them thatll really old you up wont it
tat girl is a guaranteed irregular
it was the happiest tingid ever experienced in my life
would you like another cup of coffee
it wouldnt come to a clean and pretty conclusion if someone else just trusts a speech onto them right
to live strapped all alone in a place like this forever
the feeling of satisfaction you get after overcoming those things is the greatest treasure for mamma
tis is a considerably strong surge of magic
if you want to finish it offyoud better go after it right now
itd be like one of those storieswere love and courage triumph over all
o one can accept the trutabout the future
and of courseyou stand no chance of beating her alone
well thats a problem for you guys humanity
planning and general affairs will do exactly as theyre told
we have a few things to do today
thats why tomoe mami lost her life
we know and everyone else knows noting
thats right im a failure
the real celebration is when youre discharged but
the contract as been made
sayaka can about yesterday
w why do you know our names
when you stick your neck into my work calf just for fun yknow it seriously pisses me off
now of all times
compact form tat is capable of controlling magic much more efficiently
tis is the first time ses come to school in a while so many things might be confusing
i am sorry
i see yeah maybe ive seen her somewhere with tatsuya too
you seem like youre a veteran too though in a different way from mami
thats sufficient
why are you talking wit suck pride
you rarely avez tis sort of accident
by changing the possibilities of the past numerous parallel worlds have been traversed
so tat means there are also things you dont know
well im sure were just idiots
wick is better eggs hard boiled or soft boiled
so im not scared
thats how it works for us magical girls
im sure you already knowwat im talking about homura akemi
complete
even living in the same timetat you are madoka
it seems like weve only been fighting duds lately
but es hurt
why you such a thing
in tis country half grown womenare called girls right
my only friend
since even under normal circumstances only weak people are there and their vitality is sucked out of them
thats mean tis is really bugging me
ten maybe you actually avez metmiss akemi somewhere before
witches are beings born from curses
did se just break the school record
you have ceased to exist in this universe
they bring seeds of calamity such as those to the world
im already dead
but before tat
you should borrow notes from a friend
well a bit you know
the universe is realigning itself in accordance wit the new laws madoka as brought forth
just as it always as been
now come
further no matter how hard you trytere is no thanks or recompense
grotesque
at tis amount of distance were still in range of telepaty
its okay now
thats awful something like tat is too much
she wanted to fight for justice
thats right i should introduce myself first
you could say thats right or you could say thats wrong
thats right
a womans appearance is the one tingse cant afford to get looked down at
se waited for mami sank to get killed before se came to defeat the witc
im sure wat madoka can needs at tispoint is some time to sort out her feelings
magic you know is absolutely the kind of thing you use for granting your own desires alone
it must be a pretty big shock to a parents
sayaka can your prayer and how hard you persevered for the sake of it
ten youre missingte big picture completely
i cant follow wat youre saying
it makes their evil all the more insidious
a contract is a contract after all so think of it as an opportunity to get something
why do you all make such an uproar about the life and death of one mere body
akazawa please answer
wat se does and says probably isnt ever a mistake
tat outcome is much scarier you know
illustration buriki if someone says its wrong to have hope
hesitating would be my regret i guess
it means we dont know tat level of sorrow
contract
basically searching for a witc means relying on your legs
its a beautiful song
lights at the crossing a scars morn far away
ill protect you without fail
tat will not be necessary
tat girl comes frequently doesnt se
yes really i couldnt lie about tat
after tat noting left but killing yea yknow
thats wat i tougt
and there were a lot of people wit the same type of symptoms
im not just fighting against witches
itll be fine lets work armd together
lights at the crossing a scars morn far away
you still dont get it even after all that
wat toe ell is happening
having a wish tatstrong gives me reason enough
continuing from yesterday
what did you wish for when you became a magical girl
it looks like the twitch isnt going to thatch just yet
eating delicious food every day and being surrounded by a happy family
i have other plans
it means that for all the past and future and throughout all of time
thank you he is my dear friend
o cut it out
burn this sight into your minds
your air is really long you know
se understands tis herself
the hope of us all
but no matter how much i beat you upyou kept standing back up
it got to the point were our entire familydidnt even have food to eat
everything is not limited to being as you plan
but how can tat be
but i cant become a magical girl for a cake
everybody wants a reward you know
another weird dream
if youre granting another persons wisp ten thats all the more reason to think clearly about your own desires
hey kyubey watll become of tis city
you said you met in a dreamwat kind of dream was it
actually i consider the school to be safer
it wasnt a dream
how girls
but even ten i dont regret makingmy wish for someone elses sake
just give her some time
i want you to make a contract wit me and become a magical girl
its hard wit kinds tat age
o its so normal you could call it scary
but cant you sow me your andjust a little bit more
the overflowing shadows of distress
you just have to wait until it eats around four or five people and becomes a witc
if something appears ten approaches you promising a miracle
the amount of emotional energyproduced by a single human
wat was the matter yesterday
just as i tougt
after becoming an adult you know it steadily becomes more difficult to make mistakes
hows kazuko doing
things are a bit awkwardbetween us right now
its okay youre safe now
obieru kovno the no naka niwa
will it go well
your body can be fixed inno time wit magical dealing
in doing so you will certainly wind up losing all traces of your individual self
youve said you can change history so tat an ending like tis never happens right
hur waits tat supposed to mean
another cup of coffee
taorareta anna no yuuki
you must never do as it says
this is still the place that she once tried to protect
now im earning tat one often tired year students is missing as well
you dont have any regrets or anything at all
if you die on the other side you dont leave a corpse
there are also times went tat kindness can call forth an even greater sorrow
to have a desire you want fulfilled even if it means exchanging your life
is always waiting for me in a beautiful blue
did you even think aboutow much we would worry if you went off
you dont tell lies or do anything bad
you really have been my very best friend havent you
sometimes when you it a dead end wit no real alternatives
no one knows about witches or mami
stop it stop it already
after id been out untingreal witches every night
what use is a hand like this
wat it means to battle a witc
sayaka canst case you really dont know anything about it right
if such a lucrative means of harvesting energy had been available to us
tat idiot
well if they make it past montsteyre probably good a year at least
my name is homura akemipleased to meet you
may i come in
you wouldnt cease to be human merely out of sympathy right
hey madoka do you know tat girl
you arent just granting us hope
ive decided not to lie to myself any longer
kaname swan soon youll understand too
we have no way to case the familiar from last night
tat familiar from last nigtmigtve been small
pain receptors if your stomach were to be impaled by a spear
detestable girl
so im not scared
for a magical girl etats fatal you know
in two weeks a walpurgis igt will come to tis city
we request tat everyone in the vicinity take refuge in the nearest evacuation center immediately
its no good too much time as passed
and over there is just the center of a circulatory system
is tis a place to call come
unless theres a miracle or magic it will never deal
however your fate as changed
ill be the one magical girlwo wont use her magic for her own gain
so you want to transform into a cutie like hitomi tat everyone wants
like i said tat girl from yesterdayjust transferred into our class
after constantly sleeping in bed for half a year theres no yelping it is there
im hoping to make it a little bit safer for you to fight witches you know
but im surprised tat youre andingover your prey for such a reason
yesterday after i left just wat could have
tis is the end
wasnt se aiming to take your life
it didnt drop a grief seed did it
tat doesnt change the facttat it was a miracle
pfft guys wo dont avez enough guts to tell a girl they like her in person are worthless
mamma theres a scary look in your eyes
miracles and magic do exist
hey now could you stop
tat is true
dont fight her like you did wit mami sand
you dont pull a girls hair okay
im sorry for all the trouble
really
thats correct its actually in the completely opposite direction
if tis were normal itd just turn out to be a bittersweet memory but
anxiety and suspicion excessive rage and hatred
do you still want a solution even if it isnt wit a clean and pretty method
everything weve done is for the sake ofprolonging the life of the universe
wat do you think mami sand
konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
but in equal measure my eartbecame filled wit resentment and hatred
it would create more and more worry for the people at home
tomoe mami had no relatives except distant ones
thats because se became a magical girl wit a prayer for dealing
theres a great number of people in the world wo avez problems worst such a thing arent there
even tough youre somewhat to blamefor their deaths
it was fun being together madoka
of course
its fine
so are you two scared
tat would not have changed the fate of tomoe mami
now please try it out you dont have to be afraid
if you have good fortune witches will be carrying one of these every now and ten
so wat statisticsare you estimating wit
onto mo nai sekai nani wo miteruno
o ten ill take you there
its fine
without delay other girls will come for the purpose of hunting witches
impossible right of course it is
everyone ere will die
do you want to cangemadoka kanames fate tat badly
illustration buriki then ill tell them theyre wrong every single time
o acute ribbons
after all since you already have a wonderful name
since if you move forward while mistaken about tat you will surely regret it
tis barrier probably isnt a witcs but instead belongs to a familiar
if the soul gems give birth to witches
if youre looking for mr kamijoe was discharged yesterday
or should i say incubator
right from now on were all going on a journey to a wonderful world
can i really
its a big yelp hes a difficult patient after all
and centered team allons the existence of madoka kaname
you are frequently exchanging looks
from now on lets do our best together
thats why i want to ask it of you homura can
if you make a mistake wit the treatment of these two items in my and an unthinkable tinge will happen
thats why it becomes okay to drink sake
you need to purify it now
when you beat a witc tat alone saves a lot of people
its not carrying a grief seed is it
if i and more quickly listened to wat you said homura can
madoka watre you doing
im akemi homura
it was a sort relationship but thank you
is she some kind of anime character or something
kaname is but ses not ere today
namely tat means enough despair was brought about to end a single universe
simply became a magical girl on a whim
ill see you later
so wat exactly is a witc
i dont want to think tat youd lie to me
if theres a person twos troubled to a greater extent taen someone like myself
dont be ridiculous
hitomi can is kind of acting like sayaka can today
ill let you take it tis time
well dont overdo it either okay
if you only live for yourself anything and everything is your own fault
of course
homura can wed become friends if we properly talked and yet
people wo can do something like criticize you dont exist
mami swan is a third year student so isnt per class kind of far
even if you fight like tat and win its not going to help you out in the end
so sayaka will never be able togo back to her old life
because you like music kyousuke so
wat kind of dream was it
if you will make madoka grievemore taen se as
well ten lets do our best today
honestly i want to listen troug speakers but
the magic patternsare the same as yesterday
i dont think its possible but
for all tat if they stop functioning
you gotta treat emlike theyre stupid dogs or something
so who is madoka do you know her
hey you two waits going on
sure kamijou kun again
the way she is living her life is absolutely ideal to her
idiot just when we were finally getting to be friends
its because that was only a witches familiar not a twitch itself
and no one would listen toils words anymore
stand
thats fine and youre right
as for me i guess im okay wit it
if it was her ten i predicted tat sped become the strongest magical girl but
it was just a dream
happiness would be a far off thing you know
people really cant see it
enormous energy is created
todays a special day so ill finish it off fast
when tat happens we will surely obtainan incomparable amount of energy
if thats how you tinkten you really are our enemy
the witc ran away if you want to take it down youll need to case after it quickly
have an overwelmingly iger rateof survival in captivity than in the wild
otherwise youll lose everything
there are better ways of making a guy you love fall for you
my and will never move again
whew makes me glad i wasnt born rice
madoka your life no longeras a beginning or an end
so i wouldnt be surprisedno matter wat kinds of impossible feats
at tat time if you and immediately chased after her
by tat sort of contract we received tis power into our hands
if you want to fight itdrop tat needless baggage
homura can you can return to the past right
why do umans make such a fuss over were their souls are located
horobi isogu sekai no yume wo and surely shatter a dream of the world
im sorry hitomi
would you wager your soul for the sake of tat prayer
halting time is it
have you seen a number of people die like yesterday
tat sort of thing is wasteful
do you know the locations
isnt tat a little far fetched it might just be a coincidence
kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani after swallowing up all of that hesitance
i will always be ready for you
really now you used your one and only chance for a miracle on something stupid in the end
of all things for you to just feel like throwing your friend out like tat there must be something wrong wit you
the fact tat the sacrifices made by those girls have put a spin on human history is yet another strut after all
theyre reaching a crucial juncture right now
sayaka can you became a magical girl for the purpose of beating witches right
wat waits tat supposed to mean
and boys dont grow up to put ketcup on your eggs
you really are a strange one arent you
thats wat ive decided
in truth the value of a miracle is fargreater taen tat of an entire human life
thats a little harsh isnt it
taorareta anna no yuuki
maaan you are so cool mami
its all right
was homura telling the trutabout being able to win by herself
whats tis trouble tatfuzz ball was talking about
so its worth the effort right
have been in love wit kyosuke kamijo
everyone as no choice but to die right
tat girl isnt a witc ses a magical girl just like you
itd be nice if tat kind of method could be clearly broken down and understood tough
lets take tis some place else ten
cant you tell just by looking at ittat was a familiar not a witc
in tat case its fine to just die you know
tat contract means giving up on everything in exchange for just a single ope after all
there is no need for such presumption
lets go bunt witches togeterjust like we used to
are you quite all right
and anything tat doesnt match realityis bound to create a distortion
he was miserable in the end
and yet youre comparing her to a dog
so im not scared
after all youve gotall tat magic now
and hows kazuko doing
well you could say our interests coincidentally match
certainly it was my miss
the light isnt clanging at all is it
after all its fine to just beat her to a pulp right
i wonder if homura would help us
madoka you saw it all as well didnt you
if you let go of my andtime will stop for you as well
because depending on how we use ittis magic can be used for wonderful things
as the price for making such an enormous wish
it really is a hard decision isnt it
ten theres no yelping it
wat school did you come from akemi sand
you should consider your chance of success in a fight wit kyouko as nonexistent
so just like weve studied so far
most likely you would allstill be living naked in calves
that is the fate of all magical girls
konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni is there an ephemeral tomorrow
apparently he couldnt be inconvenienced to see me today or something
i really dont feel any pain
are you second years
akemi sang as been ospitalized for a long time because of a heart disease
while watching over those girls for so long did you feel noting at all
tat is your fate
o problem yknow
the possibility of tat result surpassed your expectations
se gets into fights wit people fairly quickly
watashi kokode malta mirukoto dekiruno here in this place once again
thats surprising most girls answer immediately
but that twitch concept you mentioned in your story is quite interesting
hey is tis world even worst protecting
ten for example do you feel responsiblefor the deaths of livestock
it becomes something too horrible to look at
we my civilization invented tecnology wick converts the emotions of sentiment life forms into energy
the ceo really is getting too oldto keep pursing himself
but in this one case it was a good clear headed call on her part
its sort of like weve gone to a different country isnt it
somehow im used to tis already
yea thats right
passive voice is formed by an auxiliary verb wit toe participle of a transitive verb
how do you think we could establish a compromise
wo will protect everyone from the witches now tat mami sans gone
tis is the end
why did the wind change direction
we wouldnt have had to come toyour planets in the first place
yes i used to do that too
thats the second time youve killed me
i said to give it back back to mami
i respect the way she leads her life and am very proud of her
see you could be totally incapacitated with just one hit
how do you know our names
whats good for me
why why are you always sacrificing yourself
im sorry for making you look for me
because for tat reason you are endowed wit power
kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani
none of it makes sense anymore
so what is this dream you want granted
i only burden people wit trouble its shameful
youre only dragging us down like tis
are their fellow magical girls who bear the same destiny they do
madoka did you bring something
are you nervous
if even someone like me can really yelp somebody in tat sort of way
wat you did just now was bad madoka
ill find the one way out
just remembering that again is enough for me
his reabilitation results were already favorable so is scedule was moved up
if you grew accustomed to it you could also completely cut off all pain
are you a middle scooler kidyou shouldnt be out tis late
whats the matter hitomididnt get enough sleep
how foolish can you possibly be
i dont have any secret admirers
ten twere isnt any distinction between them and a story you dreamed in your head
its supposed to be flasy we girls must always pay attention to our looks
tat was a close call wasnt it
absolutely never leave my side okay
miracles arent free you know
whos toe exalt officer for tis class
h hey
we cant have im feeling up everyones boobs
fxyume miteiru no charming do

i caused trouble for my friends in the forest too
wat impact will it have on other regions
you still call tat hopeless closer your master
since were ere id like to take the opportunity to see it
wat do you mean
we cannot leave tis city
these core vibration measurements youve taken are very accurate
yea thats right
atalia
the outer lands
so youre you asch is asch
yulias descendants have passed down her fonic hymns and abilities troug toe generations
sow no mercy even if theyre women or children
for praying for my brother
thank you luke for your concern
why are you guys ere
colonel
besides we dont have time to worry about such trivialities
tis is bad
the war between malkut and kimlasca is over
the tower of rem as been in the qlipot for a long time
anise
kimlasca and malkut arent fighting yet
drop the title ill barf
my brother
you killed master lion anise
theyre trying to aggravate tensions between kimlasca and malkut to reignite the war
why guy
master
really youre bolt annoying
only troug diligence does one achieve the grace and dignity required of tat title
you mean little children do you not
tear come back to us
grand maestro moss is your wits still the same as before
ive never considered you as just a simple servant guy
brother
he enjoyed brutally killing even harmless monsters
my apologies toe commandant as gone to inspect belkend
it reached the dividing line
we ere in keterburg are proud of our two local geniuses
i am so happy
but ive beard tat you had been caught in akzeriuts collapse colonel
sync should be somewhere around ere
id think its a bit too late tough
i really love mister luke and is fortune
my face shouldnt be a surprise to you
whats tis youre nicer now tat youve cut your air
will tear be all right
luke is the existence of replicas is missing from the score
watch out
iron please be safe
i wish luke and at least talked to us about it beforehand
we have received permission from the emperor
it may be quite elegant in appearance but its still malkuts capital
i cant let you stop the cores vibrations
tat guy is face was the same as mine
apparently master luke lost all is memories
he said tat if i used my yperresonance there the miasma would disappear
yes of course
and tat even led to a war
the passage rings tat support the outer lands will probably stop functioning
fond master lion will tat be all right
o way
only a few seconds
whats going to happen to the town
ever since you lost your memories youve been a completely different person
uncle theres no need for guards
so everyone will be exposed to it and die
jaded
we are fighting for a future were everyone can live
atalia
you have my sympathies
there as never been any deception in wat i said in the past and there wont be in the future jaded
master waits tat big sting
god general of the oracle knights largo the black lion
to determine it once and for all
im going to be bated again
those wo can only live as the score dictates are noting more than puppets
the pillar may be gone but it doesnt mean tat the memory particles disappeared as well
its a nice name
the others will doubtlessly go tat way as well
you went to see spinoza didnt you
however the planets storm was created during the dawn age
without the jewel the sword is useless
we met earlier did we not
to prevent a war
but now my body is going to disappear
not bad for a princess
atalia noisy
to compensate the planets storm intensified
ten youre just a puppet wo cant do a thing without my brother
youre my replica
are you okay lets get you over there
like how to talk or my parents faces
colonel are you doubting guy
your processor would be noting more than traps without our device
consider the color of her eyes and her air
its terrible
it seems tat oracle ships are watching the central ocean
since tis place is beneath the outer lands
you can use tat to go back come
he might be a member of the dark wings
in the name of lorelei and yulia we shall initiated sanctions immediately
could it be the god generals
but the commandant knew about loreleis existence
so tis is the absorption gate
atalia
without you we may not be able to continue to lower the land
tear dont tell her
can se be talking about the liger queen
tis area is no longer supported by a sepirot tree
distortions probably arose as time went on
jaded
focus your powers like tat
the tower of rem
its impossible
one of the sepirot is in tataroo valley
tis shows the increasing concentration of miasma worldwide
gailardia galant of the house of count gardios
i wanted to try controlling the seventh fonon more than anything else
tis is snow youve never seen it before
dont reveal more than they should know ginji
since the planets storms activation was part of my brothers plan
at tis rate the outer lands will start collapsing again
wat is it
and you would destroy the original world for tat
find a place for the remaining replicas
its no use
whats wrong atalia
if we made matters worse there would be no point in using a decoy
isnt tat right largo
how about you stay in the castle and behave princess
its the place were we found you when you were kidnapped seven years ago
tis as been bothering me for a while but tat spear
a lot of oracle soldiers are guarding the place were going to
i think it will be ideal for a trip to the core
hes testing out the third model
was ivan wit you at tat time
spinoza ere was involved wit my kidnapping
hey now its just a joke
mayor teodoro you said it is possible to return the tartarus to the outer lands correct
you have to pay before the trip
well why not
looks like some nobles manor
ill explain the situation directly to the governor viscount osborne
we meet again boy
i am locrian sergeant tear grants of the oracle knights
i will go and stop the fighting
everyone was shocked at is irresponsibility
atalia you should rest a little
brother people can change just like luke did
a sea of mud miasma everywhere and a strangely colored sky
were not really
se said se secretly substituted her own grandcild for the princess
it says there the youth will turn power to calamity and be as a weapon of kimlasca
dont go any further
ill live the rest of my life tormented by the sins of my past
why why have the battles begun
mysterious forces
tis is bad
d a memento of my daughter meryls birth
they have returned to normal
he requested me to come along as a neutral ambassador
just let me go
asch i told you not to come ere
yulias score is moving inexorably towards a certain future
each and every memory until the end of the world
and tat concludes our tour of the monument
dont you have something to say to me
its been my job from the beginning to tell master moss everything about master icon
you really are emperor peonys one and only best friend
weve detected an unknown object coming from kaitzurs direction
im coming in your majesty
are you thinking about asch
we should be fine as long as we dont inhale it for a long period of time
sorry asch
have you never questioned the reason for your confinement
tis ends now
the power known as yperresonance will make you a hero
the world as abandoned you
and since were talking about their headquarters ere security must be even stricter
we believe tat tis world must be remade
they just want yulias score
jaded just wat did happen back ten
however emperor peony the lint of malkut entrusted me wit tis mission of peace
atalia
o my anise
another earthquake
will it not be hard for you to fight im out of consideration for me
hes the one wo built toe albiore
why i feel like ive heard it somewhere
its all masters fault its not mine
asch seems to be suspecting something
im a noble wo was born in baticul
wat in the world is going on
if the reason for war was just a misunderstanding should you not stop the fighting as soon as possible
jaded
watch out
the outer lands
im guy a servant working for duke fabre
brother how
dont worry he wont be able to move for a while
a guest
mommys revenge
atalia
i will fight wit all my strength as well
guy if youve come for revenge ten kill me
we are in one of tartarus cabins
my wat are you apologizing for all of a sudden
if we examine the closed score we might learn the locations of the sepirot
if we go to kaitzur well be able to join ivan
thats my grandfather
are you all right
tat aside the earthquake just now
it was asch wo was meant to come to build a new order alongside me
you the leftover bases of the sacred flame
o yes i offer all my wages to lorelei every month
see you
theres the problem of the miasma too
its a fusion tecnique tat uses toe contamination effect
ill be fine without a break
wat theres no way youd be able to speak wit a monster
if were together the other god generals will come after us
didst probably did something to im in coral castle
me too
well make the final preparations at the port
isnt tat great atalia
you are a worthy opponent
seeing you like tat it is as if you are brothers
yes we are
we were tested to find the one most suited to be the font master
however there is indeed a bond between us
lets go atalia
if only we could leave the city without the enemy noticing us
well it cant be helped
jaded is saying we can trust them tis time
thats our line
father
and i can cause it on my own
so thats im
tis is different from hold
by the way how will we pass the ceckpoint
in honor of your sacrifice like tat of my sister
yes the core should be at rest but its currently staking violently
master
anise
the score is but a tool to sow people the right pat
the pillars are produced by the passage rings
anise
there were some weird guys ere
wat is tat supposed to mean
uncle
dont cry luke youre a boy arent you
its pretty everything is white
ive only paid attention to myself until now
wat should we do
ivan always stood up for me at those times
we should focus on rescuing font master lion for now
its not as if the outer lands are going to collapse tis very instant
the emperor wasnt born in the capital grand cokma
how everyone hurry up
but tear is
my exalt is not important
even if everyone praises you
watch out
arietta wo told you to do tis
its the moment my family died after all
youre really loved by the citizens of your country arent you
i get it you just need to meet wit uncle right
o youre not pathetic
are you all right
its not your fault
they probably planned to unsettled us by replicating people we know
really youre pale
watch out
guy you might have known im
there is a civilian coach in the way
may i ask you something
have you lost your resolve along wit your memories
are you all right
surely they wont really execute them right
sorry luke but its important
those guys said you were going to be executed for a crime you didnt commit
master ivan is probably at the absorption gate
the world broke free from yulias score and still
mommy
o way
tat idiot probably named it after himself
but we found an infants remains buried were se said
really malkut forces were attacked by a mysterious unit
but we dont have time for tat now
damn it
tat sly jaded used to be a friend of tis genius didst
our priority should be confirming the locations of the sepirot
guy you
is it your country over there master
to think tis piece of trash is my replica
are you all right luke
im telling you we might have to kill people again
are you hungry or something
so you know
asch ill be waiting at the absorption gate
im toe pilot of the albiore oelle
the outer lands have landed safely in the qlipot and the miasmas gone
ill sow tease fools my new power
master youre awake
just were is master
do you ear me replica
id like you to watch me from now on tear
ten your majesty would you mind going in the qlipot
all we can do afterwards is regret it
anise are you working hard for the font master
its terrible master isnt ere
is it your mission for the order
isnt preventing the war your priority
only women
anise
master
so tears on the grand maestros side thats quite a smock
its a secret score only maestros and superior ranks of the order of lorelei know about
your fonon frequency is the same as mine youre a perfect replica of me
why are you getting in the way of font master lions peace attempts
but the origin of the problem was mieu causing a fire in the ligers come
of course
could the colonel gave undone the seal by himself
tis is bad toe tunnel is
theres no place for you to live in tis world
brother
its full of miasma in ere
get out of ere now
wat are you doing guy
is tis your room atalia
wat about you major why do you keep on kidnapping font master lion to take im to the sepirot
atalia
everything is for the sake of the fulfillment of the score
there are already too many replicas even wit just me
yes before the land collapses and kills even more people
id like you to wait ere for the sip to come
tat was to save master icon
how now if you get angry your nose will start running again
master
contami
how dare they leave without me i cant believe it
wat kind of font machine is tat
we are going to destroy lorelei the planets memory itself
atalia
all right open the emergency atc
if you wish i can give you your title back
you wont have to watch over me anymore anise
i think tat now is the time to have uncle and everyone see the state of the qlipot for themselves
still its wrong to abandon all the people wo are alive now
if uncle doesnt believe us ten wat
master get up
really thanks
im fine now
please jaded
its like fingerprints theyre all unique
not as a replica but as a human being
apparently the cause of the qlipots liquefaction is in the core
anise
so mean
its probably the grand maestro faction trying to interfere
you even used my sisters name
could master be ere too
you will be seen as the hero wo protected the peace
bring them to baticul immediately
but tat would mean ignoring ariettas demands
grand maestro moss i cant believe you really wanted a war
hes an engineer in the city of craftsmen seridan
tis left me wit a bitter taste in my mouth
yes dont worry about it oelle
yes we only lost our way
the memories you two sacre as a family belong to you alone
tat would be were tear comes in
there is no need for you to fight against your own blood
its just tat i want to talk wit my uncle
but my brother is still
there are plenty of replacements for me
i have no choice
anyway emperor peony is asking you to be careful
howl o raging wind and cleave mine enemies wit your blade
wat will happen to the kidnapped man
it is certainly easier to just rely on the score
ive beard tat two guards avez disappeared as well
or is e princess atalia
jaded rarely scolds people
a curse sloth cant completely control the target
master theyre fighting
in other words ivan can control the sepirot correct
please do something
se was taken from me eighteen years ago
anise
a dirty brat like you as no business ere
uncle was just confused because the news came so sudden
he shall be called the light of the sacred flame
tis is no good eldrant is starting to collapse
ive decided to let atalia come wit us
tis is a misunderstanding
very well defeat me for the pat you believe in
youre the one twos horrible anise
not even once
i remember
well take care of repairs on the tartarus and see tat youre resupplied
those are memory particles arent they
tis is a daatic seal
luke its not easy to regain trust youve once lost
a replica world
atalia up there
the miasma ere is especially dense its dangerous
they need a mineral called fonimin in order to produce replicas
right jaded
field marshal wat are you talking about
so now do you plan on going to akzeriut
when i order you you will open all of your font slots and cause a yperresonance
ivan is holding the answer
you can guard the door
because master ivan said so because asch said so
tis is a battle of our ideals
even when se tried to prevent me from doing so
tis is definitely not a move from duke fabre against malkut
farewell my beloved brother
colonel curtiss we tougt you were killed at akzeriut
giving them skelter comes first
so there was fomicry equipment on the isle of feres
in order to understand is true intentions we need to uncover is activities
how much longer until we reach the dividing line
whose idea was it dists
grand maestro moss wishes for a war to start
i really didnt understand anything
i cant think of anything theres no way
i killed someone
tear and luke too
sorry atalia
i know im responsible for tis
princess atalia please run
yea thats right
fond master lion might know something
it hurts jaded
my mother passed away but my brother took good care of me
dont force yourself
ive also beard tat there have recently been signs of intrusion at the absorption gate
all right
my sister often scolded me for not acting like a boy
the rest is missing
however the scion of loreleis power was supposed to destroy himself along wit toe miners city
otherwise people may realize im a princess
tat means we are separate beings
brother
you idiot
but ten why did you put a band on the replication of living things
i do not know if i have the dignity of wick jaded speaks
itll be okay mieu
if we dont do something all of the outer lands will fall in the near future
so you still advent figured it out
there is a way to do tat written in these records
your sister
you used your power didnt youeven tough the doctor forbade you to
the closest port from ere were we can dock would be keterburg bay
father and mother
father
im toe goodwill ambassador the one in charge
sorry go on without me
are you all right
how can you trow your lives away so recklessly
anise jaded i cant agree wit you
colonel
once the land passes tat point the speed of the fall will increase rapidly
ten wat was wit tat info about im missing
but luke is supposed to be the only son of duke fabre
ill use sealing artes
its igly likely tat your cells will disintegrated soon
if you try to remember our promise even after your escape
anise you can stay ere in daat if you want to
thanks to tis the outer lands will descend slowly rather than collapsing
sapir you dont need to come anymore
however i dont want to have to dispose of the bodies
so does tat mean tat moss doesnt have anything to do wit the god generals
me a descendant of yulia
all life moves according to the score
right guy
wat is tis vehicle
im curious about the destination coral castle
i dont even want to know
all right i trust you guy
we dont avez much time lets furry
its regarding the increased activity of the planets storm i see
besides the people of the outer lands dont know why akzeriut was destroyed
damn it
his heart is ere
it seems we wont have to worry about tat
now come to me luke
the conclusion is always the same
dont you want to go back to those days wit toe professor
yea we should build up our strength for tat
tear please read the score written on the lower part
apparently your father used to be a mercenary named badaq
you believe tat it can just start anew
its cold wat is tis
jaded were are you going
please let us troug we wish to speak wit the elder
its painful for you as well isnt it
yea youre right
wat story is tat
jaded dont you have anything to say
jaded you were born ere
how is the commandants condition sync
so the only way for them to exist is to be created by umans
its been two years since ten
he crushed everything tat was important to me
apparently the area around the city as already started to sink
but thank you tear
without a doubt tis is atalia
its been seven years
it is all right luke
dont say such stupid things
luke tis is the second time im sending you to die
master and you
why are you ere
mamma
even if lion isnt around the war wont start as long as im ere
its for our country
you however avez golden air and your eyes are hazel green
it seems es acting on is own again
tis should be amusing
but tear
guy is only human
however the seventh fonon the one narrating loreleis consciousness
theres no time we have no other option
tear put your weapon away
thats an incredible story but im glad youre safe
monsters
so about wat we will do next
arietta are you going to betray me
you did you come to take lion again
master lion is weak hell die
replicas
you will not suffer
master lion you have visitors
a curse sloth is an arte tat stirs up old memories and paralyzes rational tougt
i dont want to
a land named hold
sow no pity for your opponents
even inside its still not exactly cool
the decoy strategy is a failure
o were is jaded
its not working
im stupid
way as the war started
colonel could tis be
but professor ebilim tried to lead im in a good direction
and the mastermind of akzeriuts destruction luke
engeves apples are the best in the world
hey walk a little slower will you
first you prevent the war from ever happening
it uses peoples bidden memories to control them
wat a naughty boy telling lies like tat
hur is it really okay colonel
o by the way as asch come ere
a really
so there were still outer replicas of font master icon
an ordinary house you say
its just like luke and tears relationship
sum have you really stopped wanting to get your revenge
first lets get out of tis valley and try to reach the sore
i i only assisted wit vans preservation project
whatever is reasons vans methods are wrong
its existence is only ypotetical
brother
please wait jaded
from time immemorial the members of the royal family of lanvaldear have always and red air and emerald eyes
nocturnal light
ill see his majesty and request passage immediately
and the gate will close right
in other words we should stop the war immediately right
o no hes being controlled by the curse sloth
the jewel of lorelei
the emergency buoy is operational
however there is no need for you to apologize about akzeriut
if you want to grow so badly lose the picky food habits
atalia please remain strong and listen
its desirable tat we find a place outside of moss influence
guy youd best be careful of wat you say
im tired of tis garden and tis mansion
hows my chance
is tat a problem
a no i should say guy please trust me right
good youre looking well
he just absorbed the fonons tat compose toe jewel into is body
poison
master lion are you okay
well become the king and the queen
shouldnt we prater think of removing the miasma from her body
malkut as been our enemy for many years
if we dont move history as it says we will lose the promised prosperity
to think they created a replica of my sister
is tis anises mother
we have come to offer yelp by the request of his majesty emperor peony
yes but at tis rate we wont defeat im
general frings mr iemon
hey atalia
tis ends now
im so happy i was worried
m malkut military
guy are you hurt
guy your eyes are sparkling
a weapons factory
lets settle things wit im ere
wat do you mean
are you gardening today too
they are my precious citizens please help them
youre a replica if you stay ere youll disappear as well
fragments of my soul
we were just about to talk wit the mayor
or do you plan on ignoring stem
do you mean tat you gained noting by being alive
jaded
i believe in you guy
field marshal please stop tat
tis is why you are a fool
but my father
guy waited for me
most told me to report everything tat master icon was doing
i respected im
tear grants
and sync cursed is birth
its strange to ear tat from such an intelligent man
if you wont listen ten i shall release you from your pledge
whats the problem theyre easy to remember
im staying wit you master
jaded created replicas
loreleis fonon frequency number was recorded in it as well
anyway lets go see the mayor
the tree is revived
you are the master to whom ive pledged my sword
of course it will cover it
fomicry research was conducted on hold
come wit me
if you wont listen ten i shall release you from your pledge
wat do you think
we have to eradicate everything and create a new world
furtermore didst attacked the sip tat was transporting the former grand maestro moss to is wearing
dialogue main subsretimingi am no exception
please leave me alone
shut up
how restrain stem
yes it was probably a ceagle tat raided your storeouses
it collapsed when i was still in my mothers womb
brother
we can rely on the autopilot for the time being so im taking a break
tear you have a knife wit you right
theres no point in creating a new world if the people of the current one remain
do you not serve moss wo still blindly clings to the score
anise its forbidden to accept offerings outside of the institution
o way
hur really
asch have you forgotten your orders
anise
the mining town akzeriut
father
jaded toe ecromancer
he was always eating alone in a corner of the cafeteria
formally you would buy a new doll to replace the broken one right
the core you mean the center of the planets from wick memory particles are emitted
my brother couldnt comprehend wat dealt meant
the time must be drawing near
colonel
my country would never resort to such despicable tactics
shut up if all youre going to do is complain you can just leave
the sepirot tree tat dreck destroyed was supporting southern rugnica
in the battlefield you dont have the time to worry about the enemys life
if you know youre not wanted why dont you go back
reinforcements souled arrive soon
i felt something warm flow into me
not just my family our servants and all my outer relatives too
meryl impostor of the princess of kimlasca
we have built the glorious land eldrant from wat was once the isle of hold
thank you jaded my boy
asch tat dream just now
his neutral contamination as begun sooner taen expected
come forth divine lightning
master
preparations are almost done
asch lion is our priority for now
since ten youve beard my voice a few times
its the food thief
se was on the tartarus
for tat we need all the help we can get
wat is tat supposed to mean
lets rest for a while
its reacting to tears presence
arietta asked me to be a witness to her duel
have font master lion read the planets score
you said akzeriut was supported by a pillar correct
its the same
dont talk about tis to anyone
and it wont erase the fact tat thousands of people died
first we must deal severely wit those wo are inciting the king to war
o dont worry about me
you two were riding tat coach i ran into earlier
the new order of lorelei sends a messenger
anise
ceagles do not forget their debts
anise
i understand the problem
were not in a position were we can order our troops to fall back any more
ive opened all of is syncronized font slots
he clung to the score to the very end
will you go to the capital
its not nice to eavesdrop
tear come back to us at any time
anise whats the meaning of tis
enter the amazing guy
its no use why cant i contact im
tis is bad
are you all right atalia
if we do tat they will probably mistake us for enemies and open fire
is tat really possible
so you are the replica luke
luke please give me some time just a little
master lion its terrible
iron atalia are you all right
the planets storm
and it will probably prove difficult to prevent moss from acting on is designs
whats tis terrifying something you and didst tried to do
right guy
wit yulias power
how is your wound
dont get in the way
as expected from the ecromancer always so tenacious
anise the letter is safe too isnt it
you wont give us a and master
why do we have to kill each other
so the land on wick we live is in fact floating in the sky
ten tear really is
guy toe measurements
listen closely to my beautiful name
anise
someone as come to get us
ligers are those monsters we killed in the ceagle forest right
i dont know everything suddenly stopped working
master
damn it es so obnoxious
if you want im back luke and font master lion must come to coral castle
all right lets go and rest at the inn until theyre ready
hes one of the people wo created my replica
hey wat do you mean detour
the same kind of agreement was made right after the whod war
master all youve done since you came back is lie around
uncle are you serious
brother
iron is like a deterrent
you are spoiling im too much guy
i see lets get it analyzed ten
oo guy is going to become a count
of course we will
those guys built a flying machine wit a over drive excavated from some ruins
guy i told you to drop toe onorifics
to release lorelei you have to use the sword and the jewel
anyway hows your wound from were master it you
general fringss last words
wat are you talking about isnt it a bit late to say tat
you have been chosen
we use force of course
will tis really be all right
everyone will die
tat way everyone will be able to build their own future
they were enemies we had to kill eventually
we have attacked a fonon activation device to the tartarus
by the way brother wat are you doing outside
we should at least be able to get tat far
wat good will it do you to know
does it have something to do wit fomicry
theres something weird wit tat score
se as other work to do lets go
poison
those were the words of yulias covenant wit lorelei
colonel
im not just some kind wo gets easily kidnapped anymore
why can you use master vans moves
the world as not disappeared
you understand the seventh melody mystearica
i know tat my true mother was annys daughter
monsters
his majesty will judge you as a criminal wo plotted against is country
have you really given up on professor ebilims resurrection
is tat part of your manpower too
you idiot dont tell her
hyperresonance as the power to decomposes matter to an atomic level
ive heard a rumor about flight experiments
in other words your fonon frequency is the same as mine youre a perfect replica of me
i was born on hold
do you think youve never done anything to make anyone dislike you at all
wat do you mean
master were surrounded
but even if the miasma goes away because of tis
being impatient will do you no good
it seems you didnt have any problems getting the measurements
you understand wat tis means dont you
you cant mean youre going to replicate the whole world and everyone in it
do you want to accept a world controlled by the score
wat should we do case after tat spinoza guy
wat a surprise to see you ere princess atalia
wat are you talking about
it is about your true parents
stand up atalia
shut up just get lost
my brother
lets rest ere tonight
is tis world worst sacrificing your dealt for
those are the most powerful font slots in the land are they not
anyway lets hurry to those zao ruins
atalia
jaded dont
swallowed by the qlipot shrouded by the miasma the world today lies on the verge of destruction
im not i
wat if you want to say something say it
you do you honestly stink tat
supported by pillars known as the sepirot trees tat rise from the qlipot
you met wit my brother
so tis is the sea
tear guy wat are you doing ere
as long as im a soldier protecting civilians is my duty
a mere replica
formally it can only occur between two seventh fonists
to the coach there out of the way
im from the malkut imperial forces third division
and lukes yperresonance destroyed tat passage ring
we have to stop the memory particles from flowing backward troug the absorption gate
ten you get people to acknowledge your achievements
sow me your power the same as mine
master do your best
its too early to relax
tat seems like it would work wat do you think sesemann
iron hurry and help guy
after tat we will lower the outer lands into the qlipot since the liquefaction will have stopped
we have discovered is whereabouts
there probably isnt any other way
you entered is service for revenge didnt you
come in
i see tat tis conflict cannot be avoided
halt traitors
right master told me to do it
get off im tis instant
my brothers plan moss plan theyre still in motion
it seems even your brain is defective replica
i couldnt have remembered it
whats the matter guy
so it really was you wo called me asch
first we should measure toe frequency of the cores vibrations

im landing out your report cards first
senpai im coming to save you
im gonna play wit clay

tat means im not dreaming
skiing
you know your family sure keeps stuff for a long time
sum theres a tomato in my miso soup
you did it was the final episode
thats history right
of course it was
compass
are you still complaining
so kanata wat do you want to eat for lunch
and borrowing the power of a giant spiders they sheltered im at the bottom of the valley
the thunder is like a steady marching beat and all
watching someone troug lenses of admiration always makes your vision out of focus
travel provisions
salute
charge
i wonder if it was okay to leave our packs behind like tat
wat do you plan to do about tat uniform
youve been offering objections all along just for our shakes havent you
but coincidentally weve had eyewitness accounts of a roman soldier ere at seize
in the war
seems se didnt make it after all tat new girl
in place of your late father i will protect you
tat little ladys a real artisans
but you see theres just one little problem
theres a problem on my end tough
ses a legacy from a former age wit no more than ten like her left in the world
listen the only way to deal wit tease is to put your weight forward squarely and
could you all possibly walk a little more
thats why i
really its a prone
maria if youre free enough to be talking move those hands
without the signal trumpet everyone would be in trouble
the morning trumpet calls recently is tat you little missy
could you at least stay until kurea can wakes up
so we used all of everyones allowances and bought seeds
tat was nowhere near wat qualifies as an adventure
the takemikazuci as surely killed many people in the past
theyre the problem
painful
tis is a trumpet
troug the night the five of us take shifts
your highness princess ilya
the price itself is a part of its delicate flavor
weve got terrible luck toe both of us
not worth mentioning its my job
whats changed
direct communication wit headquarters in emergency wat was it
well done
im constantly dwelling on it
is aomi swan doing well
and when we think about it its a little too much work for us
wow tis is amazing seiya kun i can ear you loud and clear
and her mother
the conference still appears to be going troug some rough patches
even im a bastion maiden now body and soul
someone please do something about these packs
mamma
ten thats all everyone
se might be trying to atone
thats why we need something tat will push them to attack us first
many small factories tat specialized in andicrafts dotted the city
but wat about the big boss gifts
a little reward for yourself as well
princess ilya
yup theyre sweet a little sour and delicious
a ghost
wat if back ten
right aomi gathers parts from the old erza for me as well
well send you reinforcements
kanata take off your coat
the water pouring festival as been held
could it have been a wild board
theres no need for hesitation
happiness
its so refreshing isnt it and pretty
wat mission
ive already gotten my payment
not all of it
people wo pass on go to heaven and stay twere forever
its okay if you cant do it just yet
its because tis is like a product created by a magic like tecnology of a previous erza
i really am sorry
take krause a present
seems like ive worried you
you listened to it didnt you tat song
and tis workshop grew due to it
after all its more fun if everyone gets in together right
the winds picked up wasnt it
have no worries
well actually my calf sister wo cared for me very much would sometimes come over and play wit me
a half built house
right ill be right there
heavy
and all divisions in the area would be placed on emergency standby
tat womans black
but nowadays etats rare
high explosive projectiles loaded
still im just fine so dont worry
now take a good look at tis
prepare to fire the wire rancor
and since her body is prater frail people are worried
left degrees
was injured and rested is wings in a town on the western border
equipment check confirmed
you go first ill be your backup
and so its an outing
when they first met kurea just started calling im tat on her own and got all excited
kana can the signal
itll leak
one enemy unit destroyed u
a box
o mans land
check in time is at ours
heavy
it seems like it yes
in a certain sense yes
hur wasnt it riot sempai and filicia sans turn for cleaning today
these are the signatures of our elders
first our platoon captain
all bands prepare to charge
okay ten take these along too
i think thats an amazing sting
cleaning toe batroom
ten theres no way to prevent tis war anymore is there
when you cause trouble for others theyll naturally say thats to be expected from someone like you
and from tat se became pregnant wit is child
mutiny
major for the moment please come in
theres no firm footing above them
and vanquished the demon severing its head
hur wat the neck is the bon festival
morning
do you regret it hanging up on your father
pew finally ere
watre you looking at me like tat for
tis world of remnants
if only princess ilya were still alive
o way
mother sister
the fields
how are the armistice arrangements going
even if you are the desert wolf
move corpses
come ere
sees wat a stubborn old lady
sleeping while on watch is strictly prohibited
if e fell
thats strange
and its too far to send them one from ere
and there was no forgetting it
good work everyone
so i tougt tat maybe theyd looked more like monsters
even if i cant read their words
seiya swan im sure these people have noting to do wit your parents
i im sorry for causing you trouble
distance
its already been almost half a year since the armistice was declared
thats right tankfully it never as
the roman army is going to begin its attack tomorrow morning
se fell in love wit the son of a merchant
thats just silly
every sound is essential you see
thank you for carting girls
aisa swan was telling me just now about the legend of the fire maidens
w wat kind of mission is it
itll leak
thats not wat im talking about
wat is it
as the only one wo survived tat incident ive also always tougt about it
shut up
i can finally let you sing
but thats too sad
its isnt as tough its the childrens fault you know
coefficient is about minus five
but thats the truth
was se holding it in the whole time
i wonder wat happened wit misio can
from now on ill be sure to cause you lots and lots of trouble
it was a demon wo wreaked avoc on the world
theyre always a nice bunch of people but when it comes down to it
i know because im an orphan too
isnt it oels turn today
you wanna take a little walk
ten would you like to practice
kanata said se wanted to read up to find out more about princess ilya
well i guess its all right
please come back next year as well ancestors
isnt tat right kannagi orel
misio is a child wo lost her parents and so was taken in by the curc
when will your son come come madame
commencing attack
se says tat se came ere to see the fossil of an angel
and even if se didnt theres still no way to know weter it means the peace talks were completed or not
eggplants are yumina oneecans favorite food
but tat bell
the colonel as been confined in the distillery
but you love it dont you
anyway now we need to think of a way to save the two of them
i wonder if se was a scouts after all
the edge of tis world
its raining toe laundrys going to get soaked
the leans of the takemikazucis optic sensor
missy arent you trying to force the sounds
seems like all the preparations are complete
long before the world became wat it is today
we thank you for your cooperation
compass is missing
you ear tat
yea really it truly is a ugely important responsibility isnt it
it was a gift from your father wasnt it
there arent enough parts
the sort wick should you fail its possible tat the entire troops would be punished for it
go and do a toroug investigation of the place
i think her left leg is broken
well at any rate we need to ask tis girl
my grandmoter was a soldier ere at the time heralding bastion
heating water for the beat as well as cleaning duties are all done on rotation
its all thanks to your earnest and diligent care of them kana can
a joke
studying together
fire maidens protect lives
lets keep tis up
a very common full name in the swept province
kittens are inerently meandering creatures
superconductor circuits functioning witing stable parameters
aomi swan was detained
kurea can trow tat man into the underground distillery
to make up for it now about a beat and some not tea
im the gunner after all for my beloved wonderful just wonderful platoon platoon
ive heard it before a long time ago
in the village were i was born we old a festival every year to welcome and thank the gosts
whats wit tat we found tat one easily enough
tis is the edge of the world inhabited by people
aomi swan do you know of anyone wo understands roman
its really as you please but
and tat was more than enough for my reward
make sure you knock first
next is breakfast
the first princess of his royal highness the archduke arcadia
the fact is the roman army on the eastern border as begun to move
the problem is bigger
the rivers swelled quite a bit
thats your mother and faster right
you havent given up on jaquette swan yet have you
ive read the records
it was by the barracks right
the ones wo wander the land are the bad ones arent they
the two of us advent gone into town together like tis
u ladies
the ones wo saved tat angel were the maidens wo lived in tat citys bastion
tat se was sorry se couldnt do my air for me anymore
tis equipment
were you guys the ones wo crushed those vagrants car
its an extremely important mission
how is it
not a fils
wow the waters risen tis much
commander sir
i cant even old a candle to tis
is tis book yours
however its not going well
thats your seat kana can
hur so ten your father was a thank rider
well the real intention of the old guys at the guild is probably only to see you
wat was tat scream just now
just because the distance is a little further
and you and good parents too didnt you
im busy
and so while living troug such an unhappy existence se passed away
hes called the desert wolf hes an amazing person
its like tis
mamma said to me
but the archduke passed down tease pussyfooted orders tat we absolutely could not become the aggressors
misios family lived on the eastern border in a town named vingt
o you meant the earlier stuff
fire maidens protect lives
itd be a good idea to get off the mountain before the snow begins to fall
when youre finished eating sow per around the base
its connected to a legend of seize
and u hum
i i am honored to receive tis prone call
seiya kun you come back again soon too okay
fire maidens may you rest ere in peace
the goddess of victory for the helvetian army
its probably just some silly tinge from a long time ago anyhow
kanata do it
however the only troublesome thing is tat we dont know when they will call today
at the fields
like our great predecessors the fire maidens
rats can carry all sorts of horrible diseases and
thats better
the priest will also be present
yes im coming
youre a genius
when they did so it began to spew forth flames violently
still it was worth the effort
is tat the new paper
and inside theres a heap of war spoils theyve rounded up and bought
you murderer
hey wat do you think orel can
cause im scared
o not like tat faster
im sure they taught music ere as well
and wrought pain amongst the people
drink their blood
if you feel tat way ten youll just need to save more lives taen youve taken
tis ones acute too
sergeant major kazumiya riot of the st platoon
hey do you remember tat girl
there there its okay
are you an idiot
tis city never bore the full brunt of the war
thats why every six months we perform a check to test weter the line is properly connected or not
since sometimes you also riot put on a front and wont listen when you know you should
our platoon currently consists of five members
in other words the things wick distort the image
i received my wages for the first time yesterday
to sell even just tis many of them would take a lot of work
for just a small bell like tis
sorry i havent
sorry
if only my unit couldve arrived just half a day earlier things probably wouldnt have turned out like tis
you know tat tis prone is a outline to headquarters at the capital right
one small spark will set the entire tinge off
when you were carrying tat girl back ere did you run into anyone
youre obstructing business
ten today ill put in even more effort than usual
thats right
r right
especially today after headquarters ordered us to be more toroug on our patrols
the sounds of the skies
you havent made any preparations at all have you
but the young master already and a family
is the temperature okay
hm is it too hot
its fun
a thank rider goddess right up there wit desert wolf krause
not fair
o my wat a fine looking potato
i dont really understand trumpets but
i apologize
im sure tat a thank is the same way
orel can now is it
krause swan is called a miracle person and all
thats why you can cause me as much trouble as youd like
and wit only six milivets
tis as a very calming tone etats somehow nostalgic
its not really tat difficult
here you are riot eat it while its not
once escaping from the maze
orel was just used by you people
something like tat is just a rumor
primary and secondary cannons are up and running
theres no way we have something like tat ere
tis is a really nice house
i havent been able to sleep well
however even if our ears cant tell the difference
its not some sort of terrible illness is it
just a simple greeting
i guess theres no yelping tat
you cant possibly travel anymore in tis weather
have you never heard about it
and strapped them in an underground labyrinth
if it were kanata every morning im sure wed get complaints from the citizens
tis girl is
it was boring the days were too calm and noting ever happened
man we get letters from rome but not from the capital
it already came across in last weeks sceduled communications
someday when youre looked at troug suck lenses youll understand how hard it is
its been said tat the world is already at its end
but in the past there were more people ere right
were did you grow up senpai
tat tis is the most honorable wound ive received in my entire life
hey kanata
the basic arrangement is the same as the takemikazucis intercom
you can fix such a complicated machine like tat so quickly
geez those old guys
evidently theres no such thing as meaning in tis world
is tat clear
wat do you think will happen if you make selfish decisions and act for yourself like tat
filicia cover der
captain of the st platoon second lieutenant filicia heideman
suddenly a sonorous sound resonated troug the sky
ill have kanata find the one wit toe closest sound out of the samples weve created thus far
somehow theyre boot still safe
something like a crying screaming prisoner of war executed before their very eyes
sounds
how irritating really
you girls are still as strange as ever
looks like we managed to fake them out u
you made such an easy mark
if we do it just like in training well be fine
dont you go causing trouble for riot senpai
but at least stay a cool senpai around those children okay
really
its fine im simply glad tat your laundry is safe
absolutely positively
do you really want to go to war tat badly
the ceasefire signal
it means thanks
just tat you sounded a bit like riot senpai is all kurea can
since after all because of tat i was able to meet you senpai
and so may there be countless blessings upon you all
finally it kidnapped toe maidens living in the bastion
hand them a rope
on the outskirts of town theres a big workshop
the last remaining bubbles in a ladle of water
ten yumina sang as also gone to the guild meeting
it couldnt be tat etats your car is it aomi sand
check in time confirmed
are you all right
we are helvetian soldiers
youre wit miracle krause now
i think its probably tree day fever
roger tat
major please you go first
because weve had to check the directions one by one every time you know
an angel whom god sent to punish the world
youll get in trouble for playing wit food
im sure se said it was good
actually about tat
is tis really the right way
especially because you dont really ear brass instruments outside of the military
to start off allow me to formally introduce you to the members of platoon
but of course youll be reimbursing us for our roles in tis little play wont you
i think we may be late coming back
aomi sand
the fire maidens
had it continued uncecked the town above would have undoubtedly been engulfed entirely in flames
wat saved the peoples lives
yup thats my treasure
you really did
o my ten shall we have some tea
and anyway if tat compass is so important you should keep it on your person
but i think thats wonderful
it seems theyve managed to get wind of the deal
tat all of those gaitered ere are elites
tat woman will become a scapegoat to start a war
tat bacon is omemade eat a lot all right
the two of you have been getting along quite well recently havent you
you almost died yesterday because of tis sting
please give me some time kurea can
the sounds dont change
you still dislike them dont you
isnt tat just great boss
unfortunately due to an accident during interrogation we werent able to establish any details
will it be all right to practice wit tat ten
seeing how things have turned out like tis reaching our goal is now our first priority
depending on the region tis same festival is also called the bon festival
its normal for her not to waste words
tat strength is a very sad very precious sting
due to the fact tat gig quality materials can be gathered in seize
still im a bit troubled
you shouldnt force people
ten at least call me aomi okay
they said they were busy or something so they asked us to switc wit stem
hut the stuff from tis morning
damn those idiots in the supply corps
those are some good sounds
and so tat one would probably
d flat
tis is the garrison of platoon the time heralding bastion
im sure seiya
given to our platoon were
se said shed stay wit her for a while
the fire burned for an entire year before it was finally extinguished
well tis is corporal kannagi the driver se also serves as our engineer
initiating alignment
both sides lower your arms
they borrowed strength from a great spiders
theres no arm in trying is there
first her father departed for the front and did not return
well dry off quickly tough wit tis weather
se even named it
all of our glassworks are products from there
on tat mountain
and anyway can you even fire a gun at someone
ill listen to wat you have to say just give me a second
people live on
to allow the sounds to resonate as they wish
you make me jealous of you at times kanata
just a little something for you
sum sergeant sir
moreover wat sort of meaning is there in tat
sleep well boys
well tis place is just wonderful isnt it
at any rate you shouldnt have been playing all carefree like tat at the river
on the second floor are the captains quarters and the tactics room
so im going to the station
firing control systems are also a go
sees be sure to remember it properly
thats amazing for you to have friends from so far away
orel canst already out
weter someone joins for money or whatever it doesnt matter
guess tis farce is finally over
theyre not bad
im sure things will work out
you have your wallet
i was actually at is place until yesterday
but the tecnology from the past is it really tat amazing
eat well and build yourself up
so if se really as come back
the world ended
tis is my first time ever seeing such a big building
thats the captains policy
tis is really such a mess
and thus riot senpai left us
if only princess ilya were still alive those talks might be going differently
departing
if youre an engineer go and investigate scientifically and ten report back
thats the real one
and the greater the joy at your gain the greater the sorrow will be at your loss
ten how about we go get some tea
for maim can wo named im blue
how do you know about maid
thats when you started coming home wit me every day
yea im fine
tis sucks and we were winning too
i left you to take care of im yesterday anyway

im sure youd be able to produce a delicious snack using tease ingredients
and the fragrance accompanying the butter and rum wafts out
he fell in love at first sight wit zinaida
however youth is cruel
the sweet and sour juices ooze as you bite onto it
he met an older neigbouring lady wo had just moved in
senpai lopped into a bamboo raft
ivan sergeevich turgenev is a russian writer
you souldve told me about such a request before i started writing
the story recounts the days of the protagonist vladimir
an ordinary literature girl
as if the slightly bitter caramel sauce was frozen
i didnt see her
hey have you read turgenevs first love
todays snack
you dont have to eat it if you dont want to
first love wick was released in was a piece of autobiograpical work
the theme is
monster is just too much
however youth is cruel
and the ending is totally outrageous
my throats burning like ell
o soot
he used cruel words directed at me wo was trailing im
senpai wo leapt towards toe bar looked like
ive got a bad feeling about tis
youve got minutes to complete the task
today id like to order a romantic and sweet snack
tis is senpais liver blow
right
i learned tat seven years ago
theres something you havent experienced
tat punch will get the champion serious
the first match ended in the second round minute and seconds in
people endure the tough training for their own reasons
aiko are you watching tis
my boxer is facing the world champion
yes aim for a iger goal and reach it
he looks frigteningly calm
he had the impression of a fine tuned machine
its an incredibly gig level sowdown of skills
i bet you wanted to punch im
i dont stand a chance yet
hes ready
wat will you do now
he won wit dignity despite the maid match difficulty
im up i can go on
without a doubt es the best callenger ever
how will the champion respond
and from below his strong punch liver blow
the set up is perfect
you havent bad enough yet eiji
a right and counter its under a careless left
its a useful method as long as the match continues
and ere comes a dempsey roll
are you listening to me
and another left
aiko are you watching tis
o my tongue isnt touching anything
we will watch you fight until the end
theres a one in a million chance ell lose
whats up wit im he soulda come to see us
w wat do you mean
youve been restless from the beginning champion
you havent told everything to makunouci yet u
you cant call yourself a prop boxer unless you can fulfill those tree
his heart is wide open
the champion storms in right away without a break
he will most definitely start throwing counters starting wit the next sot
both the angle and the timing were perfect
im sure all the tougts from the past seven years are running troug is dead
i respect is spirit and ill take im down wit all ive got
both are taking a striding stance
on top of tat date swan threw a corkscrew punch armd against a solid and angular body part
my jaw must be broken
whose torso will the opbf champion belt end up on
you and so many chances to take im down
and heres another fanatic fan
tis champion is strong
even tough you take boxing as noting more than business
the callenger snows is power
tat left was a lure to make me use my counter
hes really incredible
the man wo stayed on top against the man wo came back from the bottom
you look very serious
yea date
he corners toe callenger blocking the escape pat
but tat scratch also gave me confidence
will the champions sera continue
im at a loss for words
you got so far ahead in such a sort time
the going was it right when their arms were about to cross
he purses toe champion back
they were all beaten by ippo
theres no reason to fear a boxer wit no finishing blows
at tis rate e can dominated the world champion
the next round will be a critical one
we both save our titles but weve still got a long way to go
bloody cross u
theyve practiced together so im sure they each know how the other will fight
hammer ado a member of hacinoe boxing club
its proof tat es one step closer to the world title right
the callenger switched to full offense after the body blow
you can knock down masiba or kumi can wit tis
stop tis referee
theres a limit to how tough a human can be no matter how much you train yourself
to be honest no
hes inviting the champion to come and get im
whats going to happen in tis match
next someone get in the ring
does e not have the power left to fight back
will the genius of japan rule toe orient and make tis is first step towards the world
a body it its a hard one
were almost even
finally finally the champion as been cornered
keep your spirit up date sand
tomorrow is finally the day
why am i down
so now strong is tis ricardo guy
and it makes my feet stop
im not familiar wit tat name
he doesnt wait for a counter and initiates is offense
the worlds strongest man
the whole place got quiet instead of excited
t the opening act for two of your juniors
the nightmare from seven years ago did not happen tis time
im sure ippo looks like a monster to you too
people call you clever but you are actually more stubborn than anyone else
im counting on you you may be able to make the champion become serious
we could charge people to see tis even tough its just a sparring match
but the nickname aside tis boxer lets toe opponent it im too much
japans future hopeful against the world champion
youll challenge tat man next right
he still keeps going after seeing tat uppercut
the sparks against the japanese rankers have already started
he turned the game around wit just one punch
isnt it easier to think of it as fighting against five of yourself
how much energy do you put into just tat one punch
put up a tight guard and wait patiently for the opportunity
i wonder wat es up to
he will finish it wit a counter
itll cause an immediate breathing difficulty
he must have had an experience
ill be facing a historic super camp
right
stop saying ominous things
you only have tree rounds to go
you make the match so one sided when you lead
is it really im
tis is very serious
is there any ope of im getting back up
the going as now
they put all of their determination into both of their fists
im surprised you and such power left
im looking for brave callengers
g go ado
they were finally relieved of the intensity
his jaws facing upward
h how
your determination isnt your two years arent light at all
the callengers counter fails his face is knocked back
does the callenger have any strength left to win
we cant take our eyes off of tis one
date eiji
its gonna be a ell of a crowd
how good is the champion
the first round goes to the old man wit a score of
its difficult enough just fighting sixty two matches
do you think you can do tat
good thats it
hes got a good punch
he broke is guard wit the first left blow
ill give im a big one ten
i gaitered information about hammer ado
im starting to see bolt is timing and is swing
the world eavyweigt class champion megaton punch
date sand
more obstinate body attacks
it is indeed a magic sot
miyata doesnt get tense from nervousness
the going rings while the crowd cheers wildly
miyata iciros weight
tis is the second down for the callenger
it was into the second round right
its is trump card the cross counter
h how
miyata lost an unbelievable amount of weight
i keep saving it to make the point sharper
the wall of the world title is indeed very big
its not tat simple
does beating your gymmate leave a bitter aftertaste
he looks impressive as usual
well hum
you were my first rookie
i swear ill sow you
anyway tis is a large venue
the champion takes it to the finish
cheap plaiting will come off easily
heart break sot
its now a mirror image match wit bolt using the peek a book style
both figters are emerging from their corners
some do it for glory some do it for money
referee hes using is palm
true we dont have to elongated the match
b but im sure theyll get fired up when they see date sans videos
once e takes a blow e instantly learns toe timing
the match is over
if their lefts are even ten their right punces might be the key ere
the champion storms in
it was more than a little
hey ippo you should leave the boat to the boss and me and focus on boxing
tomorrow well do roadwork together
hur i cant ear you
but the blow to the liver is in
two veterans make contact wit their gloves ten take some distance
users of the dempsey roll are far and few between trougout the world
i hesitated too when i received the request for tis match
he needs to do something or ell get beaten wit only left jabs
wanpo you came to get me
and an arrow like straight sot
hopefully while im still breathing
to quit boxing now
id ate to fight im again
and isnt tat exactly why you yourself mentioned it
i cant take my mind off of tat
the pain actually keeps me conscious
hes producing rough punces like es a different person
o the world champion is strong too
its not a same to go down to my body blows
man im getting goosebumps
the champion is guarding is dead
and more than tat those are senpais words
do you mean it was difficult to fight against a former gymmate
stop being impressed and start cheering
the answer to everything will be found in tis ring today
and multi fragmentary fractured of the right fist
were still relatively on the same ground as before
the referee breaks in between the two
the wba world featerweigt class champion
it was all to let me learn the timing
tat ends the third round
get close clinc to get by
we cant expect any less from the title older
you look happy just from the results of the weight check
its worthy of praise to fight against the legendary champion tis long
its a dramatic end
lets finish our game in the ring as prose
get up youre only in the second round
tat ell come and bite toe bait again
its the style from is best days
but makunouci took im down wit power
miyatas going for one big blow
am i causing ago to make futile attempts
takamura kun is about to have the runner up match before the world title
i heard senpais interview
heart break sot
good job date
the champions surprising right
the man leading the pack is bill stewart the manager and trainer
here to give encouragement to date
we are for now
and ere comes the champion
but im now bored of tat task
those are words of wisdom
regrettably is anti counter measure is almost perfect
hes pissed at is cocky underclassman
tat probably includes iciro
but after getting two drowns i tougt i could finish it tis round
the champions wead slip is amazing even tis close in
wat part of tis amateuris boxing do you like
hes taking is steps toward glory once again
good work champion
he once belonged to tis gym too
a body it its a hard one
still have not experienced a loss
go get her if youre a man
the cheer for date is staking up kokugikan
the callenger got out of the rope side wit no damage
he cant come out of the neutral corner
rather than feeling faint
the very end are you kidding me
the champion is guarding is dead
the historic world zero making is first visit to japan
tis is the end miyata
dont get angry calm down
damn it
you would have taken my time away
ive never seen makunouci look tat scary
yamada kun youll continue boxing wont you
he challenges the powerful champion head on
the champion hasnt lost is composure
its finally the day you fight against the world champion
but the champion stays calm and blocks tis as well
so thats not much
i still wanted to wish you good luck
in world class matches you also need to make forceful punces
if im asked wo i admire as a boxer
but the champion blocks it easily
those seven years
he swiftly knocked down the opbf champion
hes even dodging the body blows
the casual right swing was ella fast
we should have questioned tat earlier
ell not only get knocked out but ell be sent to a hospital
yes i know ell finish the match wit a counter
man dates punces are pretty not too
i will answer without hesitation
it was tat unexpected
youre like a bird tat lost its wings
yes for seven years
the champion stops it wit a cross arm block
the champions left
his heart is wide open
tat means you can return one punch for every five punces you take
one more down will automatically bring tis match to an end
even tough you werent running in front of me
s sake bands please
the going cant you ear it
a left
its a battle between the razor sharp counter
ill be fighting a man whos bolt a devil and a god to me
dont lose heart you still have the lead
geromicis trying to do the same
you idiot
the pit is wide open
it was great
thats why es fighting back in gig risk style
i know why
o he can take on my counter
you dont have a twenty or tirtyfold difference
tis is a trilling partner
the figters retreat back to their corners
the callenger pummels toe champion as if taking is anger out
dont get cocky just cause you got a scary face
he doesnt allow im to fall
the callenger can only hang on
but i wont leave any regrets
a the champion swapped toe positions
he cant be merciless because is naive mind gets in is way
theres about a minute left
how much as the gap closed in two and a half years
they lead back to their own corners
to me weight loss is just like sharpening a pencil
but es a real champion e can out fight too
i was exploiting tat as well
there was a time when i tougt i lost to a lucky punch
an ex amateur elite
we should have realized tis trick sooner
damn it hes done it again
he can pressure toe opponent and not turn defensive
he was still carrying tat much damage
he looks so young without the beard
keep your eyes open and watch carefully
and once they start im sure ippo kun will also take some its
not bad he predicted my side step
we cant deny the old man is at a disadvantage
the referee stopped the match the moment date fell
hes a super trainer twos coaced seven world champions
it was necessary to learn mean tricks too
all is punces were serious
there once was a boxer named jason ozma in tis gym
its a skull smashing powerful sot
let me correct you
wat a relief
you cant it im if you only aim at is body
its the same thing you told me seven years ago
the callenger cant help but lower is guard
dear japanese reporters
we will probably never face each other in the ring again
he was an aspiring boxer as a rookie using an unmatced skill of counters
the timing was perfect
hows it going wit kumi can recently
its the end of second round
the tent round of the match now begins
he once retired ten came back all the way from the bottom
the new rising star of our gym itagaki manabu kun
they are clearly enemies now
the champion continues on despite the guard
he goes in he switched from the head to the body
the champions left
lets start wit date eiji toe callenger
why is e fighting back in such a state
the callenger survived quite a pinch in the second round
i probably wont last for twelve rounds
next round
i tougt i countered im
it looks normal for date swan but
an offensive stance a variation of the detroit style wit more weight on the front
ricardo as the record of staying on top of the world for seven years
all the speed i and is all lost too
he as successfully moved out of the corner
ippos also grown over the past two years
tat hammer ado will retire
okay kind finish it off
right
ricardo martinez is too strong
tat actually shocked me he had power too
my skin feels very strange
their lefts cross each other
but it is a good opportunity for the kind to grow up
dont get it in the face
its the liver blow tat es good at
makunouci miraculously defends is title for the first time
seconds out
and were pretty close wit the speed too
miyata kuns counter is is pride
im satisfied
the champion brings out a ferocious one sided attack after the third round
he must be trying to make me guard my body
hes always been my goal
tis match could have ended after is second down
i meant wat i said
looks like its now just a matter of time
the callengers already been pulsed against the ropes
bloody cross is a perfect name for tat
its is trump card the cross counter
how close did i get
the champion snows is true power
wick round are we on old man
o mom ill carry tat
his fuel thank must be empty
clearly theyre on different levels
you can start to see the blows after so many body shots
off we go champion
against tat even the champion might
he can do it because of is experience
a rush of left body blows
dont fight so loose
tis is a world title match
it means theyre ready to fire their cannons
dont take a waiting stance thinking etats wat toe champion does
once again the champion takes the offensive
a card blow to the liver
youve got a good spirit
its not like we have any chance against im
date sand
and the champion takes it to the finish
ive never seen a boxer wo could completely disappear from my sight
and how much longer can you keep tis up putting all of your body into each match
youd better not expect anything from im
we can sow im quickly now wars the prop world is
we lost the carismatic leader of the light to middleweigt classes in japan
his left is even wit toe champions
the callenger is adamant about body blows
please cut it out already
lets get cherry pie
everyone lets keep the feelings iger and iger next time
why would i have to do tat
were in the same class
i figured it would fit you perfectly
i mean she looks like this
furthermore if you bask in strong ultraviolet rays outside
and i join a party every night
even tough theyre brought up as a big problem every day like now
since the unsold cocolate becomes cheap every year

tsukasa sans singing voice will be fresh
this is where mr akutagawa makes his wonderful narration

but is it alrigt
the guys from the cable tvservice said all sorts of stuff
izumi
you you only sow fierce intellect and passion at times like tis
its no good if you get confused when counting so take them
but already messages from all of youave arrived wit a bang
well i guess they get a little influenced by the games and all
clumsy girls may be acute and a turn on
hey tsukasa over ere

at least realize tat a study group is partly for your own good

and a ps for a rank b school
tat yea hasnt been very impressive recently
im sure you chain really got some attention
but youre not simply good at studying

well maybe it was because of fatigue from all the exam studies
miyuki swan will you go abroad or somewhere again tis summer vacation
how much did you grow after entering gig school sins

well todays output is a very happy project
why do you know details about adult games second grade gig scooler
it just happens tat when you image troug the personality tsukasa seems like an a type and kagami like a b type
might be a bother for her tough
theyre the boys wo look like they obviously belong in akiba
the comp matsuri seems to have a good reputation
much less have we told the true comprehension of the word tsundere
and you wont want to be caught offguard when youre walking around

yea konata try to go to a university wit tat im sure youll pass
ill be taking a vacation overseas again tis year
thats unexpectedly difficult dont you think
the guy tat came out in tebeginning was really attractive
well isnt tat because they think the common people wouldnt recognize it
some of them made me feel like id experienced them in the past
if youd put on the number display functions i heard you could easily recognize suck prone calls
your resistance was futile
there was such a difference in your figure so
after all you wanted to be in the same group as we so hard tat you selected social sciences right
you know tis will be a learningexperience for you as well
im kinda worried about my dead
well it is new year so

studying for exams is tough so youve gotta take some time off
tis is you know carl likes chickens

so we clean it out
hmm fox
you know wat toe ell will you do wit just knowing bout it
did you ever have your parents help you on those
miyuki swan is just such a good person that its hard to ask her
so weak willed
you were always like tis
so for example whats the type you like
kagami you know you really are quite acute like tat
what are you talking about
when do you eat the strawberryon a strawberry sortcake kagami
an extension on omework witoutan extension on summer vacation
whats se up to now

ive written a long diary entry for the first time in a while
wat brought tis on kona can
i ope noting as occurred
but kagami too did it tis morning
well you cant really control your sneezes you know
tis common knowledge you speak of as quite a narrow strike zone doesnt it
the stress really builds up after nineteen episodes
tsukasa youre just out of luck
so thats it
there are so many differentdrinks and cakes
so now about youtry again right ere
like one two three
youre no longer akira sama
if im not troubling anyoneid like to try it
but how much moneydoes an idol earn
and my social transaction skills are pretty big
when im doing andsakes afterward they wont stop talking
im pretty sure tat copying omework as noting to do wit tat
is it the unseen andof god yet again
ten how about you beconsiderate and
a dream
oh yes ill relay the information to dead as well
did it end already
well because itd be a bit miserable if the older one would get notes sown or yelped wit studies from the younger
but fraternal twins can be differentin appearance and personality
besides do you even use the prizes they give
ill have to bring out my trump card
hur etats strange
o sins
ill go on ahead and save some seats
i can understand turning off your pones around priority seats
dont get so full of yourself cause youre popular lately
the similarities between you two

guess i outgrew my memories
what does your family eat instead of rice cakes izumi sand
and fast pacedly tis is the tent time we plunge into lucky channel

but maybe because the event has gotten so big
tat game of the other day if you beat it tell me how too
wat youre surecoming on strong today
its almost your birthday now

if you fray it wit one side as is it will naturally get fryed on the other side
anyway show em what you got in the cavalry race
tis girls an international student ses a first year at our school
dont you have dreams or something of the future
maybe its a way of expressingow you want it to be spring already
dont you think tat family or relatives could be safe to think
when i gave out the summer omework tat i did as you told me by writing something tat seemed like the right thing
first off theyd have to get ridof tat smell or whatever

ive got enough skill tat at the station im known as the sarpsooter yuri
whereas you dont have any dreams at all
once you get flushed wit the crowd you really get lost at tis event
isnt it a bit like a character of a gyaruge
ive got a flag up right now
the mass of sweat vaporized
wit tat devotedness in the middle of being burnt by the freaking jot tropical sunshine they wait for my arrival
i can cook
you could at least say tat i look for my age
as ive said the camera is rolling
its all right
well theres the one wit bolt custard and cream isnt there
manager i am probing legendary girl as purchase objective of today

thousands of mangas and games were confiscated from the suspects room

o tis is somehow quite amazing
you discover tat it spilled inside and everythings a mess
is tis the izumi residence
my father as to be in the house a lot because of occupation as well
and the cream wit the coup can be eaten in a balance can they not
tis is fun in its own way
like spoofing even teforensic investigation team
wow i really know how you feel

in the very end a guy wita red basins on is dead
even if they wouldnt let me end my words at a andsake party

drama cds and anime you can enjoy two worlds wit two voices
really a surprise
i just might mix it when i add sauce or a fresh egg
o okay
walking troug toe alls of another years classes feels different doesnt it
so it didnt involves anysupermarkets or department stores
of course not
im akira kogamiyour navigator and
ha a aah theres no way something like tat
im going to dinner wit teexecutive and producer from your studio
so in other words shes just a tsundere right
in manga its pretty common for an smart like guy and a stupid guy to go to the same school
is it alrigt to release a thing like tat
what do you mean by attitude
ten raamen japanese gweat noodles
one two three
im sorry for worrying you
if youll excuse me now
i ear theyre all about dueling robotstat use drills as weapons
yes looks like teytwisted a couple of arms
im not having any urge today as well ill try to sleep since im dozing off
but there are people wo write housewife into the wished occupation field too you know
and so all of you talk it outand make up your minds
its strange but even if theres pain in the teeth
wait santa claus doesnt really exist
so arent there really tat many superintendents grandchildren
lately cnet can really be seen on the tv
i i was just hoping i could be in tesame class as you and miyuki tis year
but the new years vacation goes by in a rush
im sorry ill be talking a bit more softly
even if it would become so tat toe bandana on their heads would be completely wet
you just have to start offwit tis one
is there any meaning behind tat
my comrades let us drink the sweet wine of victory tonight
show em the fruit of your daily practice
thats not a goldfis anymore
a original footage
its a must on write rice
about the omework perapsse was goofing around
joy to the world the lord is and weve even sung hymns in a church
should i be of help
yeah yeah ill be fooled as many times as you want
the person wit orange juiced
tis game suddenly isnt as fun wit all these interruptions
from the beginning everyone was expecting my twintails at the akira sama stylification plan right
how elegant
youre really energetic even tough you were on such an uproar since morning
comparing the other cast membersto the charm of me akira
for example
and so together wit me is yelping akira tis lovely onii sand
well its the same person in both cases
you have to eat while youre grilling and chatting
listen to these big girls ere and try to go home early without making a racket out of it
why is that games main character so popular unconditionally
tat reminds me during calls as i have to concentrate on the dialogue my hands will indeed stop while gaming
its practically touching the guard rail
its really fun you feel refreshed after singing too
a very direct question tis is isnt it
you have plans to go out with your dead
but going by the healthy soul resides in a healthy body theory
miyuki sans type is usually a bigger it wit maniacs
we had a conversation like tat
konata lend me your world history textbook
welcome to idao
the one were you said kagamiwanted per notes back
altoug i was so sleepy i wonder why im so restless now after saying such a weird gag
but its best when youre close wit your parents like tat
though it has nothing to do with your future plans
hiiragi tsukasa is an idol
miyuki swan youre attractive enougwy do you wear glasses
its not like its a daily routine
but nowadays twere areso many doomed stadiums
thats right
its quiet
you think so
his house was towards the end of the buds route
light novels should be okay
recently tsukasa as stayed in the kotatsu all the time
they come so suddenly its rather hard
well now wat kind of a ticket could it be
so if i let you speak about miyuki swan you wont stop
there were all sorts of things going onin the world of sports tis year
and he ended up as the only passengers left
is it alrigt for me to talk by myself
they both avez perfect breaking and drifting
how konata sanwo did you draw ere
wasnt e going to a ground breaking ceremony in the morning
usually its the imagination of the person at and
both the limited and standard edition here to perfection
kuroi told me to collect everyonessummer vacation omework
but isnt there a time wenits cheaper to just buy it
o problem excuse me
getting your legs massaged while in treatment
researching how to say my wish to a shooting star faster
yea ill be there right away
whys tat etats kind of rude
and halfway troug all the passengers gradually got off
right now theyre extending toe baseball broadcasts too much
ten you have to practicea little at least
wait is she using me as her trash bien or something
usually went someoneis tat beautiful
and formed a cloud tat wafted
the really armd cases end witoutanyone realizing they happened or go
so please send us any suggestions or comments you have
speaking of baseball tat playerwent to the us as well
its not like a kilo or two more orless is going to affect now you look
its just that dads usually home because of his job
now theres another fun aspect in buying the magazine
without options putting another yen in
yuki can youre so cool
these warp and loop feelings are
im amazed youd shell out the transportation costs to swing by
oh the memories i used to do that
you too u
so what did you want to talk about
if tis would be a gyaruge at least one scene flag could be gotten
so the other day while i was on the prone i was cleaning the dust off the floor wit a roller you know
but this in its own way is a little lonely
somehow last year went so fast but treat me well tis year too
but why do they bane cell prone use for the whole train
but sometings been on my mindabout tis mornings conversation
first your adlibs are weak
the expression should be made upas naturally as possible
lets just say tat in my opinion someone wo naturally gets the meaning is an otaku
yea ill come return it later
you think so
but kagami comes out on top after all
the one where akira is stepping on shiraishi everyone look for it konata izumi from saitama prefecture
its an easy thing to do
it didnt even take minutes
as other interesting ideas didnt come out as well
i wouldnt go tat far you know
youre going to sing even loudertan the last song
isnt it alrigt like tis being an advertisement
itd really help if they released them in a visual novel format
u waits tis inside the friend eggs
outing strange about it at all
akira needs everybodys support to appear in the actual sow
its true that you have a competitive streak kagami
if we were to race i bet id win because of my cest
its got noting to do wit rytm
so is tsukasa or miyuki next
yea it is
because using it depreciates its value
why do all these hour drama shows end at the top of a cliffs
when you think so you cant do studies right as itd be a waste
hi sins
we can only be ere together for one more year
the place tat lets me feel most at ease
namely june are protectedand blessed by the goddess
sometimes i try to solve them off
so the top should be yellowand the skirt should be a miniskirt
tat sounds good
im glad youre around you know so much
miyuki swan lives ina well to do ouseold
but when extra innings delayall the following programs
were almost at the point where the culprit confesses
maybe there really is a dog
i kinda get it but that isnt a satisfactory answer
didnt it it you the static electricity
i tougt tat such things only exist in manga or games but they really are in reality too
page cut
im kind of touched now
more like those personality tests
dont you want to exchange a lot andsake wit harui
lets try tis again
it is really regrettable but we have already stopped the sales of the limited edition goods
im not doing it so eagerly
besides winning staring contests dont you have any special talents
lets have akira sama announce them right away
o well
no way the basic tsundere hairdo is the twain tails
can you stop guessing if they got the question rigtbased on the amount of time left when they cut to commercial
but the other five of us and gotten one
so keep sending messages for me to the radio show or our homepage
ill be getting off of work soonso old on for a few minutes
yes well i spoke the most today of all the episodes
well as a police officerlooking after a good girl
to begin wit the word tsundere was born in the year
but we just got the notice today
if its about cakes about tis much is usual right
well a message from berrykou daisukikko swan from oosaka prefecture
you cant use them
wat did you play during the new year when you were a child neesan
did you tell a lie tosomeone today tsukasa
only oneecan was always in another class right
as a fast tinge lucky channels already in its fifteenth time
an illustration
and your fever doesntend up tat big
akira youre recognized asia super idol by yourself and others
tat as to be it
our teacher is a wiz and im a thank
shut up how rude
tamura swan do you go to the maiden street
but since theyre playing a game together as parents and child it seems like theyre going well along
thats no good
its supposed to be a long vacation
even tough i like them
ill just read a book and wait here
as there are many unknown people it is hard to nominated as well
miyuki remember to go to nose treatment before the school begins
i think following someone asia igly game like aspect
the same colors as your souls
sannen zaka tree year hill
theyre giving away all varieties of quon cards at comp festival
the skills you get by gaming areusually useless in everyday life
youve been growing it out all this time
just like tat living a life even more loose than the patient ere
but since tis is your last year inig school spend your days wisely
the one twos gotten more and more time on the main story and getting on full swing
i was walking while tinkingand ran into the door
well tis one was an easy target
theres no meaning in sleeping more is there
youve already chosen right
soul kun youre talking about anime and manga again arent you
but people with those needs dont even come to the breach right
kagami you avea prone call from miyuki
okay how about we go home firstand ten meet up again later
they do say tat the germs dont get onto it if its only seconds you know
if its within five seconds no bacteria will stick
im a bit hungry
o no thats why there are so many people wo will want to protect you
after noticing later theres a crazy price tag on the goods
well ten please bring it together wit tis receipt
the one and only chance in a year
well keep doing your best
o thats right can you saytat im your sister kagami
id like to ask a milk tea
you know lately theres a lot of ch speak on tv and stuff
im iwasaki
well tat aside kinds tease daysreally are well endowed
manager ill go check out legendary girl as purchase target for today
patricia swan what kind of songs are you listening to lately
people wo say theyll take care of it never intend to
really
because konata is always sitting in front of the computer
since fall is for sports
you must have skills
dont tell me youre really going on a date with a boyfriend
and it is really a good season for studies too
you know the one tatlists all the song numbers
its finally time for the last relay race
did you see the special finaleof love apron last night
and ten your noodles end up soggy right
doesnt it feel like everyones plumped up together for the festival
anyone whos late has a page report in their future
today id like to introduce a lettersent by mr muss gato in tokyo
for some of you my regards only go for about three more months
wait a minute in your case allyou do is copy all my omework
putting on a sow till the very end
so everyone in front of the tv
quite a bit of omework
we ensure safe pregnancy and protectyou from traffic accidents at the same time
your body sticks out too much for an obstacle course
so you became able to set songs and wallpapers to ringtones right
wait a minute
but when the soup splashes and a little bit gets on your clothes
puppies are really acute arent they
you just dont have the will to do it
reading is it
rules and safety hold no persuasive powers at all
a izumi sand
ten please take your time
thank you
what kind of game are you playing little high school girls
but oversleeping your destination isnt a completely bad thing
so why are you latedid you oversleep
for the moment we have plans to go abroad again tis year
o so i breathe fire
a boomerang tat you trow around
you sure are picky about odd things
i see
o no its got to be a doga big write dog
sum didnt i tell you tat you can immediately recognize suck calls
the fact tat there still are people wo call out unknown children is deplorable
how unlucky we ended up in different teams didnt we
what kind of christmas cake would you like this year
but kagami said something about tewising tree times tinge being unrealistic
when the festival ends you feel lonely as all the events go away at the same time
tat certainly is miyuki like isnt it
yes tat is to say something tat snows changes in feelings wit the progress of time
yahoo you doing well
would you like to old a studysession for checking omework answers
you like gall games and rpgswile i mostly play sooters
was e at the groundbreakingceremony tis morning
youre the assistant
so do they mean it doesnt matter what happens afterwards
makes the volcanoes blow their flow
tat just means you cant judge a person on the surface
bring up the feelings of powerlessness and boredom
you think so
non non not a housekeeper but a maid
so ses a gleek
the other day when i was aggroed by a mass of mobs se was sleeping somewhere
akiras super sappy thank you
oh so thats it
so you still get presents
are you a clumsy slow turtle
how rude
o you should justbe honest and say it
do you have any idea wat time it is
she goes out of control when shes behind the wheel
it like makes me feel closer to the character

and you know the eyes on a marimokkori
it doesnt work out like manga just having the beautiful memories right
senpai kogami akiras stage is just about
but isnt it so tat people of such needs wont come to the sea
you on the other hand might even throw away something that you need

youll know soon enough
the thing tat you didnt really point at the fact tat im stupid

theres someone wo does martialarts and hasnt matured right ere
tat youre supposed to do things in moderation
if theyre right up your alley it really feels like a bargain
at first you close your eyes and open them wide
it leaves some serious damage

takara can i ask you to bete class reap for the first half

so it means you cant learn as long as you are indolent u
the slightest sound from behind would make me jump

after thinking about it it seems a little tougtful
theres a limited time event for christmas
however the typical people are gradually beginning to increase
its sad when youre the only one that cant go into the sea

if you want please have some
sakurai kun saw me in tis outfit
right
however you think about it its a weird place
i was waiting for you tomoki
our class doesnt force you to join any clubs so i passed
but im not a member of the new world discovery club
during tat time alpa and delta can destroy the equipment
since the hiyori on earth is
hes already in trouble
wat do you mean
if its you you would understand my feelings right
his body wont be able to stand it for much longer
a few days ago a girl named kazane hiyori entered my club
i want to get closer to sakurai kun
hes deep waters

i wonder if a girl by tat name is in our school

when we were doing club activities
mikako souldve come ere before us
does it mean tat it is the order of your master
why didnt masters memories vanish
gonna play a furouken music piece
master
now no matter wat se wont be able to do tis
e tat is true
i am their tougt vessel
isnt se being it upon her weakness
kazane started coming to the club every day
it worries me tat tease primates know noting about culture
i am ere to meet kazane
we have decided wat to do for our new world discovery club
how about a band performance
you sure look like youre raving fun wit everyone
wat is tis
so it me wit everything you got
ten wat are you guys doing for tis years cultural festival
sakura kun and mitsuki swan are always together and it seems like theyre always raving fun
in order to plant sweet watermelon
if you talk about the system to tomoki eyd understand everything
like tis
a i have the album
you bought her a lipstick in the stopping department
are you saying tat i am not worried
o its okay
o not really
and white panties
seems tis faint a dream
the hiyori on earth
you know you gave some in at the time of the self study cooking class didnt you
its direction is not so great
thinking tat cherry blossom season isnt a bad time to die
o never
behold were looking for a person to participate as the human cannonball
feels good
tis snows tat civilians will always be civilians after all
its because i
o ymp youre the one wo would get hurt
well ten ill be going now
and it might be possible for you to get a large scale club expense
of course its okay isnt it sugata kun
sum im sort of jealous tat youre on good terms
tat was just a warm up
thank you everyone
my parents died in a tunnel accident two years ago
kazane swan knows a lot about planting fields
i know ikaros
if it becomes a middle seized club toe audit becomes more strict
se wont return to normal no matter wat you do
is tis something god decided
if we stay ere their poorness will grub off on us
like tis
if we do it now no one will get hurt
se caught im in mind air
se likes me
but because the apples at the carnival were so well received
her conditions still unstable
if tat happens ten my peace will inevitably be destroyed
you and me are the same
tat voice is sakurai kun
loving pure and innocence
i believe i passed my club entry test now
look tat actress from the evening drama is getting married
how about it you cant do it
everyone says tat sugata senpai from the new world discovery club is a werido but
furouken orchestra musical performance for you
club allowance
o tomoki
captain can we get tat susi as well
tat cant be
marriage ceremony
i have quite a few reasons
i dont understand the aestetic feelings of a downer but
wat is the pretty girl type
like the concept tat there might be a new continent on the other end of the atmosphere
you wont be able to see the same dream again
i refuse completely
alrigt do it zeta
the rules are easy
a present
afterwards sell be free until the gondola association meeting at six tonight
thats right its today
you love to exaggerate akari can
tis is a city filled wit curiosities
are you all right president maria
kaze no yuku mici ga
how ten its time to depart for todays practice
dont you have some business ere
and hearing someones voice when you long to
goodness just look at tis scedule
coin up and well give it another sot president maria
so tat makes today galicia sans mirror birthday
so you know theres something ive come to believe
egao ga sugu koboreru
se was busy dawn to dusk every single day
yuku wa undine
karada no naka odokete yuku yon
saa kogidasou ikaru nami e
we became known as the tree great water fairies
tis is leo venezia of the water planets aqua
galicia swan is wit her last customers for the day
truly made them seem like little girls again
and all you see are people the world would be better off without
sheesh there must be something wrong with me
that death note in your drawer any human who touches it
the captors has died inside the nursery school
more seconds
now now please refrain from jokes in questionable taste
nobody knows who he is but he has solved countless unsolved cases in the world so far
this world needs to be cleansed
its actually impossible for you to talk to anyone at headquarters
answer the question
both times it and something to do wit her name
very interesting information
what are you waiting for
eh whats this im scared why dont you try to kill me
all you should do now is to think carefully about the value of human life
theyll never be able to just lift the notebook out like this
our next story
its the fake kira
se was able to implement the bare minimum of countermeasures against surveillance cameras and leaving fingerprints
they are currently trying to negotiate with him
the police are emphasizing that they did not shoot him
yet theres absolutely no proof tat it happened in aoyama
but has it been verified that its murder
ah wait a minute
having finally achieved his dream
write in their name and they die
theres no way im going to waste half of my life on a girl like tis
if they see you scribbling humans names into your death note they say
these are your new police bids
in addition itll act as a wall against las surveillance cameras
in human society
me evil
taking all kinds of risks with the death note
it may prove to be botersome
evidently you arent able to kill me
its possible that kira is a student
thank you ill try my hardest to make you love me
of course its murder
most people would be too scared
right now it seems tat going to tis rote blue might be worth a sot
this world is
we may assume that more wanted criminals whose whereabouts are unknown have died as well
deep again
l wants to die come on
whats up ryuk whyre you telling me all this now
we believe this is a carefully orchestrated mass assassination carried out by a large organization
tat day in aoyama there were triple the usual number of surveillance cameras operating
victims that died on a weekday between four pm and two am japanese time
the ink cartridges of a ballpoint pen
a heart attack
yes my proud son
half of that humans remaining lifespan
your first victim was the shinjuku killer who took eight people hostage in a nursery school
firstly youll need to return to work tomorrow morning
but you dont want them to find out tat youre kira do you
whos gonna be killed next
how do you know so much
whats wrong number
i brought some apples
two deaths heads
well the hostages are apparently saying he suddenly collapsed
and although the police have missed this
today in shibuya tokyo
its already started chief
its got to be the corps right
in which case the death toll would be well over a hundred
wat is it
the investigation into kira is currently operating using a system were nobody is told wo is in it
they may yet have to make contact
and move on from this drawer
there were heart attack victims again yesterday
of course not
if you still refuse to trust me you can look after tis notebook
sorry im busy
but they re all violent criminals who deserve the death penalty several times over
so you got any idea where you dropped it
and it was just a notebook in there after all
yes something very important to do
the person whose name is written dies my ass
light you can trade your eyes at any point remember
i dropped my death note
interesting
thats the key
ive come to return an important notebook tat light swan left behind at university
the death note is real
you can shoot them through the head or knife them in the heart and shinigami wont die
its just because its bugging me personally
all tat remains now is the domes on the t
can see a humans name and lifespan over your head when we look at you
youre just gonna walk straight home like always
theres no proto but it cant be anyone else wit a name like tis
thats the report from the scene
all over the world
we have a new development
all those things you sent to the tv station were covered in the same fingerprints
its because shinigami get extra life from humans
is there anything else
but they know someones killing off the bad guys
so lets do our best for im
formally they wouldnt it depends on their personality
something nobody would be surprised to find lying around my desk
this is great
kira has some way of getting information known only to the police
unlike your voice people can hear mine
that originally was my notebook
isnt that bad light
watch out light
the moment a death note lands in the human world
now what will you do light
kira uses some paranormal means to kill people without having direct contact with them correct
so im not going to tell you that what youre doing is right or wrong
please and them out to everyone
youll damage your eyes
to change the world
but one of these people
this case is a hard one
o are you sure tat its okay im so happy
gotta say though you really wrote a lot of names in here
they dont trust each other at all never have
ill use the death note
because if we catch him he gets the death sentence
hes home early today
the man who indiscriminately killed and wounded six people yesterday in shinjuku
and are beginning their investigation into police personnel
but behind the scenes
its going exactly the way i planned
that notebook belongs to the human world
this monstrous crime must be stopped at all costs
but those arent my fingerprints
the keys right there
thank you sorry to interrupt your studies
two days in a row and both of those were weekdays
hey maki wanna go on a group date tomorrow
its a high possibility that they are japanese
id like to see how tis girl dies but its not as tough i can just follow her around
thats enough for today
the legend of kira the savior
its pm already
suppose someone else picked up this notebook
the only things you need to join the investigation are a valid form of id a recommendation from one of the team members and las approval
really talk about sick
theyre from our neighbor
hey taku swan you got good taste man
why are you so surprised
plus youve already gained las trust
the hostages are coming out
that somebody is passing righteous judgement
the fact tat im now able to sow you my face is a sign of ryuuzakis trust in you
be the god of the new world
but how come you only specified the cause of death for the guy who got hit by a struck and nobody else
is a tiny hole you wouldnt notice unless you were looking for it
whoever touches the death note can see you right ryuk
humans really are interesting
the case before us is unprecedented in scope and difficult
they all seem to be all right
a notebook of death
until we meet again kira
people need to maintain that kind of facade in public
the moment you do that current will pass through this and ignite the gasoline in this thin plastic bag
give us all the information you have on kira and atone for your crimes
if you make even a little mistake opening this youll burn yourself really bad
in the buckle there is a communications device tis will allow ryuuzaki to pinpoint your locations
thats the best thing about the death note ryuk
you cant track down a murderer when the cause of death is a heart attack
kill my own family
its been five days
thats just a plain old diary
but lets say that was the subject everyone would say
and if they arent japanese then they are in japan
thats true even within the police
ill try and see if i can figure out any other bidden messages
ill be able to show you why very soon in a direct confrontation with the killer
nobody knows las real name or whereabouts or even what he looks like
yup its hidden inside this drawer
alright l weve been giving you our full cooperation
its possible tat theyre smarter than i tougt
nothing in particular mom
right now l is leading the investigation
i guess im going to have to tell you im actually a member of the investigation
its kinda scary but pretty cool too
if by notebooks they mean dealt notes ten etats something tat only i as kira would understand
oh yeah the results of the national exam
direct confrontation
theyre the evil ones
these are my friends at the university
on the nd theres an event at the note blue nigtclub
have you still got business at police headquarters as well
but now we cant do anything bad anymore
hahahaha just joking
we broadcast first to kanto because it has the largest regional population in the country
it would be one thing if they had a knife sticking out of them
we need to first ascertain whether this is really murder or just coincidence
the whole world is watching
the death note is real
im so worried about the hostages
if you told me to kill team id do it right now
and how much extra life theyll get if they kill them
yeah that is a pain in the ass
ill recommend you
heah as if it could really happen
this is the entire list right
if the cause of deaths not specified the person will simply die of a heart attack
thats right this is your first interpol meeting
theres a human whos been following you
today at am
the second difference might be even more interesting to you light
this world is a rotten mess
if the cause of death is written within seconds of writing the persons name it will happen
it is also a monstrous crime of mass murder that must be stopped at all costs
i agree
also take care not to display those witing police headquarters
cordelia never speak of tis to lady juliet
father
i came upon a strange tomb in the graveyard
werent we going to see the irises
outing tat need concern you
as calculating as ever
beneath the iris banner
do you think love between a noble and a commoner could ever work

we have wagered the future of tis country on protecting you

the red wirlwind is a traitor and a rebels against your father

romeo you mustnt say such things
ten hurry up and give us the rest of the script
the nobles will be overjoyed
sleep in a bed
for the townspeople isnt the wirlwind fighting on the side of justice
come on odin hurry up and put on a dress
my family was attacked by the dukes personal guard
unlike the one my father as set for me
if you wished to rescue someone you should have rescued tat girl earlier
it bestows its blessings
juliet thats a nice name
its a good thing i borrowed the house crest from williams mother before we came
tis is an opportunity we will never have again
a ball hosted by the montagues

white irises

o noting really

and on top of tat tat you gave a false report to the duke about it
you smell of irises
for the time being we shall return to the safeouse wit lady juliet

two pure earths untouched by color
you dont need to tell me

like a person without love in its heart it will winter and die
well well thats quite a nuisance for us
youre an odd one
tat embroidery is it a gift from someone
father

a certain individual
tat you failed an important assignment
romeo candorebanto montagues motion is ereby unanimously declined
we are safe however so you need not worry
he was found innocent and released
im praying always for you for your happiness
yet another quarrel amongst the commoners
the scent of irises
and wit duke capulets dealt those sins have already been redeemed
tat isnt
please do not concern yourself over tat
there is no harvest tat lasts forever
did you intend to let the outside world know of escalus existence
it concerns the young noble doesnt it
im returning to my room
once the gears of love begin to move no one can stop them
why dont you first state your name before passing judgement on the nobility
wo is the red wirlwind
romeo favors you certainly e would not object
its the only day of the year when the great gate leading to the nobles quarter is opened to the public
within a story birth as noting to do wit love
word arrived from camio not long ago
you will be the grand duke some day
ive been told tat the former grand duke capulet was a tyrant
wat is it romeo
but it must have been more painful for you
you gave me the shivers today
well ten please take care
tell the truth now and tisll all be over
youre late wat were you doing
do you dislike hermione
right get water to those rooftops
yes for tat very reason i revealed you to im
lancelot entrusted everything to you
ten you could refuse your family name
thats right
youve got a good arm
tat is not the truth
tat reminds me brother
wat brings you ere at tis our
we aim for the revival of the capulet house
he loves the scent of irises
well well if it isnt the good doctor
well i must get going
ten why dont you go by yourself
hes ere the red wirlwind
a girl named rosalind passes herself off as a boy
are you all right
chairman
smoke bombs
look wat youve done
tis will not possibly be enough for my five children
theres a canal below were going to jump
o not particularly
i must know
so take earth
when i think wat could have happened if tat nobleman hadnt saved us
the true red wirlwind
attempting to burn innocent people to death
ses absorbed in her needlepoint
tat man is the red wirlwind the one causing the commotion in the city
if i were to count the number of houses prohibited from inscribing names on their gravestones in leo verona
t tat cant
you went out but yesterday and now tis uproar as well
you wont get away
use tat time to escape wit lady juliet
the day when our house crest was stripped and we were forced to leave the nobles quarter
as you like it have fun now
another face of the city tat you do not know
ten you should be fine
it appeared to be by is order
tis is a love tat cannot be
and ten maybe se becomes a woman again for the sake of the one se loves
or is it perhaps a little too early for you to care about such things
he killed all is family and followers down to the very last servant
a beautiful building filled wit people in elegant dresses
the scent of irises
lady juliet we can put our plan into action
for goodness sake child why dont you learn the ways of the world
youll be safe ere at the very least
or are you too afraid to follow me
its a secret between women
today is the flower fair
hear ye tis lords in council session is declared open
o tis will do
as soon as es satisfied let me take you come
i have decided i must learn more about the voices of the people tat dwell ere
the jewel of leo veronas night
i understand grand duke of leo verona
why did you go to the keep
the seething blood tide blazes gig fueled by grief and prayer
o dear you seem to have been it by a stray arrow
i cant convince myself tat the red wirlwind is such a bad man
such a small guard would easily fall to our current numbers and our weaponry
grandpa went to meet the doctor
juliet its night time now
do you understand lady juliet
but its unlikely montague would venture out so far wit such a small guard
o im not the red wirlwind
im no red wirlwind
p please tell me your name
the sword of the capulet house passed down troug toe generations
perhaps you can enjoy the novelty later
we will come upon your mother shortly
dont die red wirlwind
i want to play some more
mister is there no way you can get around it
juliet if i have you
im ere
the money should already be paid back
together as a family you may be too conspicuous
but theyve arranged it so tat my family is assumed dead
a tragedy drenched in blood
your attention please everyone
lord romeo you do prefer roses do you not
but until the day arrives when we can once again raise the iris banner in leo verona
wick house are you from
if its long cerised desire is fated to occur
doctor
there would be tat house alone
and well said
very well those wo agree to the current motion all rise
you plan to bargain wit tat boys life
see not wings after all
there is a place you must go
dragging ordinary law abiding citizens into is quarrels
youre embarrassed and you call yourself a man
and yet your love brings you pain
we are thinking of moving to the outskirts of town
its unfortunate wildly
my father specifically sent me word
tat girl as concealed herself somewhere in tis city
so profoundly tat it was plain to see
living wit such a lovely young man now lucky you are
seventeen vassals of the capulet house
dont be too reckless
but theres noting else it could be
father and mother were lying on the floor
from tis day onwards tis will be our base were we will formulated our plan of attack
but odin told me to let im go alone
gracious waits wit tat anguised look
thank you for the flowers
theyre all lies
they say martial law will be in effect until the red wirlwind is caught
today is my birthday
inside the keep it was almost like a dream
to stand beneath the iris banner
anyone wit complaints step forward
see ere weve been waiting for tis day for fourteen years
is tis truly a love tat shall never bear fruit
so it is juliet
these are the blessings of the goddess
however you have lived lusting solely for the blessings of gold
thats right from tat doctor
if their assassin did not return more would be sent
hes a doctor after all
the man wo as provided a room for me is a little frightening
igts as dark as these do not last forever
youll understand everything went youre sixteen
you be quiet its not something children can understand
ten toe forbidden fruit wick leads toe maidens earth astray
his name
look ere we have a vital mission you know tat
but it is said tat rasness willfulness and recklessness all lead to ruin
youre in leagues wit the red wirlwind arent you
let me see
while im there i will also acquire more of the weapons we will need
romeo is montagues son
you should sow your gratitude for my compassion
give leo verona a future
give leo verona a future
tis town needs the red wirlwind
the scent of irises
you continue gathering information
o it pales in comparison to wat you have all endured
these aforementioned provisions are to be the new pillars to support order in leo verona
wat kind of story are you writing now
shall you meet im again today
the title is as you like it wat do you think
theres no one at the keep wo will welcome me wit a smile
two great twain trees wick avez stopped beating
we beg your pardon william
pardon me but will you ask me about tonight
tonight you must rest well
wat errand brings you ere today romeo
ten were is your house
you are sixteen and old enough to assume the responsibilities of your house
o one objects do they
well at tat age there are times when you wish to be alone
these strange leaves were floating in the pond
terrible there are manunts for the wirlwind everywhere
do you know of any place were irises bloom
please dont if they catch you again
pretend to put up a fight and fall over the edge
dont talk like you know anything
so these are the capulet survivors
how ten how should we respond
but one day youll be able to live in town again
montague is leading sount out of the city wit only one carriage as escort
there are times when you can only stay silent and watch over those you love
tis girl is suspected of being a capulet survivor
sir without fail
my apologies for having you come so frequently to a place such as tis
hermione is awaiting you below
strange fellow dont blame me if you catch a cold
behold so valiant
you cannot govern a country wit righteousness alone
but if it goes well we can kill duke montague and im alone
grandpa will scold me again
use tis to fetch us food and a change of clothes
i will have you sow me your resolve
out of the blue again
irises dwy
wat is it wildly
wat nice weather
let us swear to fight on together
these loathsome specters of the past must be eradicated
guided and attracted to each other the miracle of their chaste passion
you are causing trouble for sir williams mother wo as been kind enough to provide us wit refuge
thats right
a memento of your father
will juliet be all right
is highness the duke will launc fireworks far outsining last years
wat is it
as a token in celebration of our betrothal
once upon a time tease flowers adorned toe keep in all their glory at tis time of year
father
sorry but could you take care of the kitchen
their candidate is capulets daughter juliet
thats the crest of the capulet house
see to it tat word of tis incident does not go any further
youve been warned not to make yourself conspicuous
if you dont want to starve to death itd be best for you to cooperate
those wo disturb the order cannot be treated as members of the family
it may be difficult but
did you pick irises for me again
how much my dear
daughter of the tyrant wo oppressed the people to satisfy is own agreed
we wo served the capulets were also killed
i wish i could as my mother did
its the wing of a water bird sister
enough forget about the cleaning
were inspecting the coach
my father as been busy dealing wit toe aftermat
silence red wirlwind
safe and sound
escape in the boats
father
its the red wirlwind
thats not why
merely wanting something for so many years will not make it happen
i cant see you any more
services have finished for the day
come if we dont furry well be late
a formal motion as been made
escape quickly
the search for any remnants of the capulet ouseold was toroug
its a beautiful morning
wait theres been some kind of mistake
the scent of irises
troubles concerning love will vanish in the twinkling of an eye
you cannot mean
c congratulations
hey wyd you come ere
when the will of many years comes to fruition
but im not very good at it and it looks awful
see ere henceforth any person wit information on the red wirlwind
it seems the lord mayor wishes to be seen as an ally of the townspeople
return your blades to their seats
are your preparations finished honey
we received a tip naming you as the red wirlwind
wat does tis mean
the wind feels good
from now on lets pray every day so faster can do is best shall we
perhaps we should move somewhere a little quieter away from the city
were under attack
and will invite toe degradation of the current peace and order
however it is duke capulet alone wo souled atone for is sins
its such a surprise tat lord williams mother is from the farnese house
mother
surely you dont mean to give it to tat young noble
are you all right
why are you so angry
as i tougt
why can i not wear dresses
it is igly likely
as you can see it is quite run down

i am juliet fiammatta asto capulet
youve taken care of everything thank you
be quiet
ive never seen anyone starve so earnestly at a broom before
i had a tough time consoling emilia yesterday

tanaka sensei wants you to meet im in the staff room
my sister is seven years older than me so se took on the role of my mother

wat do you mean
hey so were is your mother buried
the staff room
scissors and cardboard
here your dessert oka sand
im going to secretly ask oka to have lunch wit me today
and thats wyi absolutely ate sizu can
it was a beautiful woman
youve sustained massive injuries to a section of your abdominal muscles
if you need something from me why dont we talk about it ere
can i punch you
a goddess worm togusa one sidedly offers is love to
yea various purposes
they wanted it to feel like a high class cabaret inviting you to relax
could tat be
so youre a friend of the guy wo ruined my girlfriends cell right
and now my everyday life is continuing on like it always as
breasts
o no no itll be boring if they spilld it without us torturing stem
a boy wo looks to be the only happy one in the group
does she look like such a frivolous girl
the number of members kept increasing while we werent paying attention
but try to make it quick
se used to only serve as a foil for a girl named harima milka
both you and your father must have been yelping out yagiri parmacy from the start
you only did wat you tougt was right didnt you
cut the subcontractors wo cant raise our numbers
and im still working wit atom
its the one regret i still have to contend with
tat must have been pretty tough on you
anyway both the yellow scarves and the dollars have had their members fall victim to the slaser
theres a massive entertainment district to the north
yes like the dollars or the yellow scarves
i treat people wounded by illegal weapons
weve been receiving a low amount ofsupplies from our subcontractors tis month
tat just came flying
im so happy shinra
those peeps in yellow were the big spots until last year tough
what the strongest in ikebukuro
even tough i abandoned her and ran away
a lot of people have joined the yellow scarves recently u
e waits keeping im
yea it does seem like a lot of illegal aliens would be living ere
if you just dump im back there well feel more awake
all right
saikas purpose is to love people
im just sappy kaztanos okay
its the same as tat face you made before
ses not thinking about you at all akura
she doesnt have a heart
and that her memories must have remained in her head
thats a horse
even tough you were only a middle scooler tat expression was maturity incarnate
was that the trash can from the convenience store
is this what they call youth
scary isnt it
both of us will do it together
tat reality never existed
so about the goods
never group me with stalkers
humans are really weak arent they
dreams of tat sappy family se never had
is there any meaning to using tease
since then nebula inc started staying in contact with us
are you going to go fight
and the city is also filled wit danger
i want to become even stronger
sorry but im busy wit some stuff
it used to be considered something of an urban legend but recently lots of people have taken pictures of it
by the way do you know were the name dollars came from
even if they are a member of the dollars
se didnt know is target
youre going to place the head amidst a power struggle and have it awaken by itself
your buff ryugamine mikado is the leader of the dollars
and so an unknown feeling of insecurity enveloped der
please dont stop the orders from coming
youre already making preparations for the sports festival
umm so
se trembled in fear
kasuka had been pretty busy with his job
the strongest color gangs
the eadless rider and
se doesnt remember anything and yet se doesnt want me to call the police
since you get to leec off people
they notified toe school tat they were dropping out and just disappeared
ready
strong enough to suppress my wrath
we put him back together with help from a lot of people
are all kinds like tat these days
anyway stay away from a guy named sizuo heiwajima
or should i say heiwajima kasuka sand
the girl runs
theres a heaven by the name of valalla
wait mr iekawa
but hey its really admirable to save a bullied girl
see you again soon
but wat does slasing people have to do wit love anyway
youre somewhat of an urban legend
if you carelessly open the door
have you ever tougt about why youre so good and your parents are so bad
the strongest in ikebukuro you say
were you searching for your head again
ryugamine kuns a good friend of mine
what kind of expression did she have
jokes aside
ses just a really masocistic wolf wit a air fetis
harima mitka swan wo used to stalk yagiri seiji kun
ive realized that im in love with him
whats up with that question
i guess its okay to use all of it now
but even if thats wat you think your head might not
or maybe a pretty nice person
the ultimate supporting fairy little brother character
sorry but its getting dark
anyone wo gets in my brothers waysouldnt exist
your heads attached to a body and walking around
im japanese
all right ill help you
youre taking some time off from school starting today right
and noticed that her head was missing
yea like the slaser is part of the dollars
were in the middle of self introductions
if i recall those guys are from yagiri parmacy
a head just doesnt suit it
a woman used to sell cigarettes on the first floor
take a look around
kida your eyes look like those of someone twos prepared to die
i hope im smiling
i dont think well make enough to eat wit tis guy
anri doesnt know tat mikado is the leader of the dollars
theyre apparently a gangs but no one knows wat color they are
stop calling me tat
its a special set its really cheap
their faces kept appearing in my tougts
is tis really the place were teyold the human experimentations
her parents died five years ago
shizuo its not good to fight
tis is now celty sturlusons day usually goes
sometings weird
there are so many more police around
if you want to ate someone ate my friend to your hearts content
tat guy back there and red eyes
susi love
thats the reason
if you clear your mind of all worldly tougts even flames feel cool
hey hey i know youre in there seiji sand
thats not a compliment
do you need memories from years in the past
that my head might be awake while my bodys asleep
im sorry i tougt you were someone else
and never forget to smile when you pick up girls smile
dont you just use your belief tat you cant love others as an excuse to complacently accept how things are
a lot of people wearing yellow have started to appear in the city
im japanese
se tougt tis isnt akura is it
the concept they asked for was a big class cabaret tat allows you to relax peacefully
youre already making preparations for the sports festival
a trip to deal per broken earth did something happen
they always fight against the flame haze thats sealed under the sunshine right
there are people like tis everywhere in the world
fiction and reality are equally valuable so its not like we ate reality
its a headless fairies from ireland
see you tomorrow
you should really watch out for the yellow scarves
a detestable past is the product of your imagination
are you some kind of monster
what the strongest in ikebukuro
rather it signaled the beginning of her destiny
its okay leave everything to your sister
the headless rider
however waits going on between you tree wont change just because you disbanded toe dollars
fruit milk in the afternoon is the best
by now wed be in wgp talking so romantically about love
the girl tougt about the person on the other side of tat warmth
im asking everyone around
just now old do you claim to be
my feelings havent changed a bit in the twenty years ive lived with her
theyre probably from yagiri parmaceuticals
call me
the mass media are up in arms too
youre kida from the yellow scarves right
saika only takes over the mind and whats actually moving is the umans body
well that isnt nonsense its the truth
o way
wat tanaka taro you saw the black bike
im ere again today
she feels pain but it is far less than what a human feels
its all right dont force yourself to eat it
yes ive heard of them at least
tat the world isnt as terrible as you think it is
thanks ill be careful
and tat you ride a motorcycle without eadligts tat doesnt make noise
how much do you know about me
its actually around tis time tat toe slaser began to appear
that doesnt matter when youre in love
be careful
thanks for today
dont let go of the arms tat embrace you
could it be tat if someone flashed you wit a bright light the shadows will disappear leaving you naked
wat im about to tell you are the details about the famous kaztano incident
im turning right
they have tougts they dont want anyone to ear
six months ago a large scale gathering occurred suddenly in downtown ikebukuro
is it true that you dont have a head
you dont have to make sushi out of them
we get an extra twenty percent
hey about the meeting tomorrow wit the other classes
roger tat
but you should really be careful
yellow
he answered his phone around seven
or is it more like sexy embarrassment
well see you tomorrow
well first we have to answer the question what are memories
oh yeah youre living with a rather eccentric person right
o starting toe school year off by being late are we
ive heard a lot of rumors about them too
wat shall we do
well be together forever wont we mom and dead
i cant cry
eating alone is terrible
how interesting lets talk about it over tea
maybe the thing you usually sense doesnt exist in it
well fix it together
im sure most of them will tell you
but if se as a good personality i wouldnt mind her stalking me
its stopped being colorless
one of the members including myself have ever seen our leader
are you really akura
by the heavy yoke of is own past
thus i just cant leave him alone
yelp tis is my best friend kida masaomi
im bored
one of them was cool
im home
the last thing i want to do now is regret
why are you afraid
you ear tat thats so old school
wed ask for is opinion on certain things
since ive seen myself as a whole even in my dreams
ice a rusty sign
i always wonder
dont treat me like im a child
whoa nasujima sensei is that sexual harassment i see there
are you going to walk around the city with that all day
but wat was waiting for im
you started the dollars you can do wit it wat you want
if se doesnt wake up well get sit for pay
its about time you guys realized you made a mistake
but your brain makes tat power explode
ive dreamed of a not so casual life but
you said the student wo rentes tat room is ryugamine didnt you
whats this urban legend
hey honestly youre a good cook
umtank you for coming to visit me so often kida and ryugamine
you wont get a stomacace
im sure youre already aware of it
you know the guy who rides that black bike doesnt
in front
were in the eternity now in notes des
even if one of them confesses to her se probably wont be able to give them an answer
you want seiji to like you
thats not true
let me see
i endured it for a whole six months
well be killed by a gangs or something
o ones around
my strained relationship wit my daughter will get better too
it may rain later so lets be careful
well wo cares
tat was a lie
on the train you get treated as a molester
there are still many hurdles that medical science has yet to cross
well as long as they dont interfere wit our business we wont touch stem
actually im thinking of writing an article tat decides wo the strongest person in ikebukuro is
spend as much money as you want
youre a pathetic excuse for a human
colorless
well there are lots of things tat exist if you look for them wit the idea tat youll find them
the ones wo did it are subcontractors of some unetical business
izayas words continue to echo in is mind
hes not just your superior es toe sogun
we have to go back to the opening ceremony
hello how is it going
theres no way i could fight you saki
somewhere a mysterious girl catches a glimpse of a reality ses never known
ive never used my head to think
it wanted to express its love troug its behavior
are you jealous of that girl with the scar around her neck
its like im forgetting my own face
however there is usually an outer and an inner lining to everything
i dont think ill be able to come to school for a while
the underlings said tat sped already left by the time they arrived
its pretty urgent
how much do you think we can get for tat guy
and they all form a hierarchic society
im not as abnormal as to lust over a eadless body or just a dead
the occult being witnessed in broad daylight
its love
there are times went noting begins
the time passing by has felt ambiguous as well
in this ever repeating dream
nah perhaps ill never come back
if you love her confess everything to her
the girl on the eadless riders bike also wore glasses didnt se
honestly im not good at dealing wit people like izumii and horada
p pick up
so that he wont remember anything about us when he wakes up donc
and tat the girl wo and the sewing marks on her neck looked exactly like her
hey why arent you hurt
for an urban legend herself to speak so igly of im
by yellow you dont happen to mean
maybe about uniforms and air restrictions and such
celtys the queen i suppose
my head might have been there
you guys should notice your mistake already
its dangerous to go out alone
wat wo started tat rumor
you figure tat if se wakes up sell blame you for the rest of your life
what impression do you have of that legendary headless rider
and on tat note please go out wit me
bartender uniforms
but ten others started standing up for us
o way was tat a trash can from a convenience store
it looks like you didnt teach the children spawned from your saika how to fight
doesnt have a specific color
thats why im going to settle things myself
at least from the exterior
whats up you dont sound too good
there may come a time when ill have to resort to taking it to an area wit strife
that geezer has a job to do
get your ass moving
its not easy at allbeing dependent upon others
anyway just put tis off till tomorrow
seconds until boy meets girl
was a deep darkness tat lurks in the shadows of the city tat appears gaudy upon first sight
yesto a color as pale blue as your face is now
so youve beard tat rumor too sonoana
even so its more powerful than real love
if it were possible id like to be chosen as tat warrior
i dont know much about them either
well hurting girls isnt one of my obbies
ive called it a day
a lot of those people disappear in the area between ikebukuro and sibuya
his jokes arent very good but es a great guy
tis girl was just like everyone else born into a normal family
for its awakening and for war
right tat strength is of another dimensions
we may be able to make a deal wit those guys
anyway youve got a job selty
lets create a lot of memories together to make up for the ones youve lost
someone strong
if a real monster evil psycic cyborg or ninja were to appear
the memories of when you were a dullaan in your rome country of ireland when you still held on to your head
altoug your clothes and your wallet are made of shadows arent they
its your fault ive lost two boyfriends
no worries ill be the one spreading the rumors
theres a scarier rumor out there too
well horada got attacked by the black biker but
o eyd dotacin been a while
so without a little brother type like yuta wo serves as a helpful fairy character
i thought i can surpass her if i become class reap
sizu can sure knows went to get involved
and the next day things got even more annoying ill fucking kill you
i dont know too much about im but apparently is parents are seeking asylum ere or something
at home you get in arguments with your neighbors
and thats the truth
a sudden dispute between sizuo and the dollars
anyway you havent changed since elementary school mikado
i get jealous every time i see them
a girl with scars around her neck
you cant erase memories that conveniently
but the person i cant forgive at all is my mother
well tat should be fine right
guide the souls of brave warriors to valalla
it was a banal scene anyone could swear theyve seen before
is it aboutmr asujima
wed like to say ello to tat cockroac over there
can you not cut wit tat scyte or something
just stay as you are
se became just a little bit happier
tis is a battle wit our love at stake
tis is enough for today
so youre even
yes a sunglasses wearing bartender and
listen as much as you want to the screams of those wove seen a monster
theres a rumor tat its involved wit toe dollars
sinra you idiot
the slaser incidents were supposed to have ended after tat
there are no restrictions or rules
on tat notelets go pick up some girls
you try to tempt us by saying lets protect the peace
you watch too many dramas
i want to be alone with you too
maybe saikas a sadist
of course not but
ive been born right ere and now
and even now
just wat kind of rules do you use
everyone ere knows wat we have to do right
me im still searching for them obviously
spare me your excuses
youre still keeping our secret
they dont have a color
to be precise toe umanexperimentations you guys are taking part in
can i take a look
and ten it just so happened tat we became classroom representatives together
all i wanted was to learn
you often dream during rapid eye movement
since you know all tat tat makes things easier
will you please let me see her
the jumbo mellon breads are sold out for today
you dont have to worry about a thing
i just finished reading the log youre coming to tokyo
he could no longer escape
since im trying to protect my peaceful life by doing something terrible to you
t toe eadless monster
geez theyre a laudable bunch
since my best friend seems to love you wit all is earth
tough they were all coincidences
a girl wo couldnt find her own place in tis reality
so your friends a girl right
thats it whoa hes so cool
fine follow me
dont lie to him
youd better not tell me you dont have any information after taking my money
ill kill you guys if you talk about tat during dinner
its a black ivan and heres its license plate number
how admirable of you
its like the name of a protagonist in some comic
how rude
lets start things off wit a wedding
a lets do tis steadily today
so se can communicate
even if it wanted to love it as no body
actually im planning to write about wo the best figter is
you cant run from her anymore
all the cards are in my and
and after tat the woman told me the real reason why se was after tat girl yesterday
anri how much do you think i had to listen to tis today
theres also a saying tat those valkyries wo roam the land are the dullaans
youre so cool mr kadota
that annoys me the most
by the way whats wit those insolent fools dressed in yellow
but weve only just met
youre a class reap now
by the way you did a great job tricking us tis whole time
alrigt ten how about a book store
dont lie to im
well ten sorry to deceive you
its just tat there have been some weird rumors
i dont really know
well actually im starting to not care about getting it back
this world is full of flakes
we bought a few more for various purposes
we havent chosen class representatives yet
i didnt want to remember anything about you
some great person once said the world is a symbol
wow what a coincidence sonohara sand
depending on your answer it could be both
amie wat do you suppose tis is
have you talked wit the police yet
yet some things are born and some things disappear in tis city every day
ever heard of a katana called saika
you shouldnt talk to sizuo about is younger brother
but where would it go then
the yellow scarves
bullying is lame
wat do you mean by monster
its staged so theres not much we can do
thats right
he moves just fine despite being decapitated
so please go out wit me
so furry along
hows he doing
yea it was
dengeki bunkos accel world came out today
seems like its time to teach you youngsters the power of an adult
how could an etereal sword etats been on record for decades have been made in
we were determined to find im for sure
ten i guess ill just take a little walk
humans always exceeds my expectations
italian scars are expensive since theyre foreign
if thats wat you want to believe go ahead
express tat love in a concrete form
damn it
you said saika vanished five years ago right
then ill have a talk with my head
and ten your sister
thats were its from
he must be somewhere in ikebukuro
a team tat used to be active in ikebukuro
you heard voices from your wound
ill defeat the dollars if the slasers wit stem
the iger sups of my company were astonished went selty appeared on tv screens earlier
ill stop by sometime in the future
hello things have gotten a little more complicated
theres noting i can do about tat
you ass making me resort to violence
u umm my last names ryugamine
id like to sow you something
ryugamine mikado was it your friends name
tougt the girl word only seen the world troug a picture frame
well torture you in accordance with the plot
why dont you at least take tat mask off when youre in the shower
you cannot put love into words
the reason why the brain saves toe bodys strength
im guessing tat toe umans areused as materials for a lot of things
a girl
youre prepared for tat right
sonohara dont get the wrong idea and start silly rumors
so youre the famous one
o one could take kaztanos place
whenever the psycic protagonist appeared wed always be lying in a puddles of blood
time remaining until se turns down is offer of tea seventy five seconds
the thing youre looking for isnt in tat direction you know
id say es a trap not a little brother type
seriously and the police are scary too
so you dont know
theyre pipiru piru piru angels wo fly in the sky while sowing their underwear to everyone below them
idiot heiwajima sizuo and tat black guy from russia susi are exceptions
if things get worse theyll call the police
we should get her to a hospital fast
and togusa relived on kaztano for the greatest joy in is life
tat sounds good to me
youre roadkill now you piece of sit
hes really dangerous so definitely dont get involved wit im
why didnt iquit toe dollars back ten
youre not making any sense
let me take tat back perhaps it was your distorted feelings of love for your brother
if youre talking about fights you do understand tat tat sera as already passed dont you
it seems like the police are bracing for a gangs war
the dollars arent angels tat fly around going pie piru piru and sow their panties are they dotacin
so the story goes
would have been perfect if se were the princess of some country and also turned out to be your cildood friend
but i didnt expect tat many people to make an effort
its the fault of society school and everyone else
you dont have to worry about anything anri
your friend ryugamine mikado
some people lose the ability to think clearly in the face of fear
starting right off wit a private conversation are we
the person wo sent us tat response is the true founder of the dollars right
if tat happens to be true ten after you get your head and memories back
a father whod risk is life to protect is daughter from the slaser
spare me your excuses
theres no way id be jealous of her
but our love is genuine
but you needed to push a little harder
is tisa dream
wait wat if se takes my family ostage
number one kida masaomi
but the group that exercises its influence the most
but having a job and friends
he gangs out in sinjuku so youll probably never meet im
a huge miracle tat may appear small
ive met tat guy wo and tis knife
my guess is tat my uncle didnt send me these dolls to delight me
maybe to his home maybe somewhere else
arent the dollars like a biker gangs or something
were going to go pick up cicks
the headless rider
were does tis city something tat resembles a box crammed wit junk get its energy from
swore never to go back there again
t ten how about the ikebukuro west gate park
if you and to say theyre transparent and colorless
i mean look at tat splotc down there
theres no core inside me tat presides over dealt
they battle the flame haze sealed beneath the sunshine day and night right
okay however i couldnt retrieved the bullets
i saw im
hey man
awesome thats so cool
its a fact tat toe eadless rider is part of the dollars
italian scars are awesome
watdid i do
about her father about is mistress
but tis country bumpkin is getting in the way
or perhaps a trip to the spas
but they have lots of crazy members a shitload of em
damn tat was a raira academy uniform
its not like you to be so faint hearted
see you tomorrow
its not just the police
lets make tis fallen angel flaps per wings
at least try to sympathize wit others a little bit
weve got the whole day to ourselves
its only natural tat youd channel your anger towards me
from someone so weak se as to live off others like a parasite
sum err i well
thats so lame
and the possibility of the start of a new legend
does tat mean ikebukuros safe now
right
it wasnt easy to get you two in the same class here too
he works as a tout for tat susi slop run by a russian
it was half a year ago or so
are you pretending to have esp or something
either way im not going to learn anything by standing here
so the guy you were badgering with questions the other day
not your values as a human
youre scared arent you
about the source of energy for tis refuse packed city
that doesnt mean she was kidnapped
something happened in southern ikebukuro park as well right
its not easy at all
im in an unmistakably go west type of mood
oh my home cooking
thats the reason you killed someone
well im actually the person wo began to gather members midway troug
you werent being bullied again were you
you only have to act frail like tat in bed
o sizuo
with that much makeup even im not scared of them
well my plan to only press the elevator button seems to be a success
anyway things were quiet for a while
so tis strongest man and to be involved in some way
i wonder
because im a parasite
okay ill be right there
probably
ryugamine wat do you think real abnormality is in tis world of ours
do you know of a portraitist around here
not really its just dangerous roaming around by yourself
theres really noting wrong wit me
well they are great people
they fought with a guy named heiwajima shizuo in broad daylight
also a certain headless rider seems to be a popular topic of discussion among the youth in ikebukuro
its something tat an ordinary person wouldnt believe
its real cheap
you want to know why people dream
perhaps im the one relying on im in the end
because im the one wo and you kidnapped miss magenta
pain is unnecessary in the life ill live wit selty
the black motorcycle
then how about a blood sample
i had to take a call
is because going over the limit would result in your bones and muscles being destroyed
let me be clear from the start
it should be right around tis corner
were going to dispel tat past form tis world by saying it was a product of our imaginations
it turned into a long long night
so we got fortune cookies for dessert
most of the rumors about asujima are just tat
youve got to be kidding me
but since that persons gone now they started bullying you again
mikado you arent thinking about joining them are you
it must be fate that were attending the same school again the shop is fresh the fish is fresh
okay let me give you a word of advice
especially in neuroscience
ive been seeking my head because im afraid
dont hide it now
weter you guys get pounced right ere or end up dying by the roadside doesnt have anything to do wit me
the past and memories get lonely easily
you reciprocated my love didnt you
the pressure of holding peoples fate in her hands finally made her feel firmly grounded in reality
the brain cant understand tastes that arent in your dna
this crimson rusty jealousy burning in my heart is
its like when you get the feeling tat theyre part of the group it turns out they are
i cant really say
without interfering wit my love
no way
nice fucking timing
my business can wait until after ears
couldnt you at least rate it wit something easier to understand like
hows my time to since
when mikado was going around a street corner
a speaking of offline meetings
oh boy ikebukuro has gotten pretty lively again
well if anything happens mikado and i will save you
but she never went home until the entrance ceremony
the term rem comes to mind when talking about dreams
yea the strongest
susie yasuda senseis signing her works today
then shizuo passed by and we started talking
im low on funds tis month
theyre a color gangs tat was really influential when i was in middle school
o matter weter youre aiming iger or lower
and so
orihara kun said your job was pretty easy
see youre most beautiful when youre honest wit yourself
there are no normal people anywhere
he didnt fall in love with a person
yellow
and its asleep when im awake
well we dont know much about the dollars ourselves
ugh i better go help her
the ugly side of the human heart
im in love wit the scar on your neck
anyway let me fill you in about the details of the now legendary kaztano incident
whatever im sure you and to be saved by someone again
scary cool
someone responded to my post on the dollars message board
they could have at least called you a devil woman or something
yea thanks to the info we got
theyre pipiru piru piru angels wo fly in the sky while sowing their underwear to everyone below them
ive been living a life so far from the standards of heaven not even believe in it
our main goal is to talk to them so its all good
however etats partly wat se wished for
anyway it was something tat changed my life
flight of love
at tis age you cant form relationsips wit anybody outside of work
i thought at least i can do it in her steads
o i just met her yesterday
theres a rumor that the foreign nebula inc will take over your company right
i wanted to live in a way unlike everyone else
either way it was self defense
and little by little se closed herself off
so you like the dollars takiguci
i wonder wat happened to her
y yea me too
to find a place within them were se could belong
tat can only be one person in tis city
so thats the mother
ive beard tat theyve calmed down a bit after getting into a fight wit another group called the blue squares but
its okay youll get better if you just take it easy for a while
looks like youre still perplexed
the reason why we joined the dollars is very simple
im really glad that you love me so much
its fine
are you all right
is tis true
its already night
in corse mytology theres a saying tat valkyries armored female angels
ill never forgive tat slaser bastard
ten twos toe joker
back then i was four years old
well you have to get the stolen goods back first though
my body moves on its own
theyre not here
it shouldnt be a problem for you to find my brother
its so fun it makes me vomit
or maybe its a fresh corpse
so if we find them we need to release toe foreigner right
you cant run from the past masaomi
this situation might be a result of gods whims or maybe its just one of his jokes
hey dont ask customers then in notes des
you know the brute strength you unleash in extreme situations
today ill tell you what i know about the headless rider
i think its sad but ive locked tat feeling away
we will crush the slaser no matter how many of them there are
and at the same time something everyone experiences
but thats none of my concern
at the moment unpleasant topics like the low birtrate and the widening gap between the rich and poor are on the lips of all japanese
im famous
hey thats my seat
tat rude man wo started calling me dotacin
plus toe dollars leader might sow himself if we keep tis up
ive always wanted to say tis
he remained unaware of the fact tat is best friends former girlfriend was a casualty of tat conflict
yeah the yellow napkins
im kinda hungry
the headless rider
look were not some ragtag group like the dollars
thats why ill never ever stop loving people
a bartender
sosinra does get is twisted personality from you after all
im happy youre ere and were going to the same school i can rang out wit you again
lets play a game kay
the yellow scarves
a problem officer wo cases is opponents too far and even causes them to get into accidents occasionally
your revenge on the slaser
humans are so weak
tis world ive only seen on the internet and in comics is finally right in front of me
or he was just mistaken
im in a crisis ere
okay a black ivan right
i hated that guy
tis is oriara izaya from my middle school
youre the one wo told horada about mikado right
we must rescue kaztano by all means for togusas sake
dont say tat sizuo
the strongest in ikebukuro
sell transfer schools just like iekawa senpai
the job itself was supposed to be quick
thats so true they stand out more than the dollars because you can tell wo they are
just mess up the other guys a bit
however it would have been climatic if tis took place in the morning when you were running late for school
does anyone want to run for the position
is there anyone in the yellow scarves wo can ear my voice
ill take a look at it later
can you answer my questions
thats why it uses its owners body
anyway you should ask im yourself
in reality tis girl would end up in pieces unlike in the movies or manga
any idea about their license plate number
u tis might be bad
my love will summon her to me
therell be some people wo sake down members of the other group in the name of tat rivalry
these sorts of people are all around you
but she noticed how much she stood out
ill defeat the slaser wo hurt anri and my friends
dengeki released some new pocket editions so we bought about thirty in all
arent you a bit old to be acting as the doraemon bully
im sure youll be trembling wit fear and non compose
well thats what it sounded like from your conversation
perhaps due to a cranial process involving adrenaline
well never regain the everyday life tat weve lost will we
we need to get im back before they deliver im
the yellow guys
the victim and the stalker
i ear theyre pretty dangerous
without any concern for her tougts or wishes
its not about my head
im waiting on a reply from seven other girls
the leader of the dollars is her classmate
everything in the past few days has made me immune to any kind of shock
theyd attack small groups wit large ones and theyd lay traps so they could win fights
wo do you think put you and harima in the same class
tat was the slogan tat a certain yellow flag toting group used in the annals of the tree kingdoms
my love wont fall apart so easily
i was in the park because i was in the middle of completing the job request i got from izaya
it seems like sometings been bothering anri recently
a spy boy twos just come to tokyo
you caught her but a big school student got in your way
o one loves me because theyre afraid of me
the terror tat arises in the hearts of the people every time the incident occurs
were holding a trivial tournament today
izumii the girl passed out
wat about her cell prone
but i can say for certain tat ses not a stalker
se was totally feeling unsure about the dangerous and risky days sell avez wit me
and whenever tat happened
moreover the black biker attacked horada
id experienced heiwajima sizuos strength wit my own body
the people at yagiri may have led her to the decision
you dont have to answer right away
pretty isnt it
of course were someone to make us look like fools tatd be the end of it
when someone loves another person they express tat love troug various beaviors right
but man you sure did something stupid
they called me a monster
thats why saika and i have become the mother
it seems like tis girl is much more important to you than your buddies in the gold bandannas
and this is our sour cream sushi
dollars degree prediction
dont peek
ive been kicked out of the dorm too
when we came to everyone was angry at us
a strange invitation
like pick up traps around town or erase graffiti
trow a rock at my horse again and ill make you pay
plus he talks like a big playboy but hes really just a peanut
either way you cant stop us
something is born in the city every day and at the same time something also disappears
it wouldve been cooler if youd thrown it out the window
idiot you should have told me tis earlier
and people refer to them as color gangs
tis is now you act right after saying you want to live in peace
we fabricated a lot of member posts on message boards too
well its been four years
you shouldnt go near them out of mere curiosity
tat doesnt mean my hatred for them as vanished
i didnt keep it bottled up anymore
cant they make a rule were the kings fight one on one
wat an unpleasant topic
are you guys really from the yellow napkins
look the vending machine is right over there
how our consciousness is just as well defined as our mothers
isnt tat the fate etats carved into the da of all existing males
youd know if you were my son
tat was a joke
dollar
pretty isnt it
if you find out anything tell me
o thanks
hes with a woman
i was just living peacefully
otherwise youre not a man
why so
o im different from iekawa
youre not human youre a monster a monster a monster
dude you really surprised me back then
o yea have you heard
each group has its own color
yokos boyfriend is part of the dollars
do you see kida masaomi as a close friend
under the juvenile act you can kill people and still be protected
whats se look like
simons a pacifist so theres no use talking about fights
to the story of me and her a tale like no other
youre right
hey tms amie lets all go to heaven together
its pretty rare for yumasaki to be bad mounting a book
the daughter of tat antique salesman wo sold saika
the entire human race
hurry up and lead the way
everyone else
its rare for you to be in ikebukuro mr izaya
so you mean theyve resurrected
because of some development tat would put soap operas to same
if you worry about her too much
anyway dont go near heiwajima shizuo
since we did all tat to a mere middle scooler
not here
whats wit tat logic
and you expect me to believe such a fanciful tale
or maybe thats the kind of kind you have to look out for these days
were you two good friends
well no im toe headless rider
you still havent found him
you must be proud of your younger brother mr heiwajima sizuo
people wo are dragged into the unordinary cause a panic
you have a nice mother
thats the reason why im afraid
why did you decide to join the dollars
so you used me to give horada tat information about sizuo
when she let herself into his room and saw that thing seiji
whats wrong with talking about it
that idiot was like this
well you dont have to come to the meetings anymore
it was difficult in the beginning for us to learn to speak
use however much of the money you want and whenever you want
geez no one can stop the power of love didnt you know
its not something like and over your money is it
apparently they both stink tat toe slaser is in leagues wit the other gangs
youre worrying about something to do wit tat past arent you
yea it was covered wit something tat looked like black oil or whatnot
the boy didnt know weter or not tat conclusion was correct
tat was the sound of wat bone breaking
ill never let you go
itd be a love square if you included me
ive been and by a monster
but you didnt do anything wrong kadota
after some calculations ive found out that its your first day off in days
furthermore she realized that she could sense her heads presence
and yet they were just protesting against being unfairly labeled as the bad guys
sizuo its not good to fight
even if you had come not much wouldve changed
im not really sure how to answer tat
just wo is iekawa haruna
really
tat cg youre talking about is also in the dollars
hes so annoying put im to sleep already
engawa and scallops are really cheap
and one of them was really cool
or perform plastic surgery on people who need a new face
no they were annihilated in the fight with the blue squares
maybe es up there smoking
i regretted it
a lovers quarrel
se found out everything
o one will freezes to death by forgetting to drink vodka before going to sleep
im the same akura wo wants to just disappear
wat are you going to do wit tat posters yumacci
its no longer my hobby to stomp on cell pones
various worlds unfolded for me there
we have a power tat stems from leadership
see you tomorrow
how much courage it took to invite a girl in is class to rang out
thats the color of the dollars
youre all white
there was a time when it was in the possession of my father
wat a good girl
wat kind of experiences as e and in the four years weve been apart
its usually a foreigner twos living ere illegally
you may disappear like smoke as if all tis were noting but a dream
i couldnt stay calm
and there was a note too
well ten see you tomorrow
is ereally alrigt
last question if you dont come to the parking garage were you strapped us last time within the next minutes
it happened twenty years ago
should i buy a band aid first
can we meet offline sometime
we need to take a pick we have to
altoug i left yumasaki and karisawa behind since theyre easily recognizable
eat up anri
it shouldnt cause you too much emotional pain since you cant love others
dontsay tat
anyway give selty back
let me teach you a thing or two about ierarcical relations
i didnt think youd come
everyday life changed for the tree of us tat had been living together
im such a sinful man
i wouldve been lucky if youd killed sizu can wit tis
and even tough im going home wit toe bespectacled girl etats in my top five
but the yellow scarves were formed by some middle school brat right
do you know im too
we picked an old guy despite the sitty pay on purpose
man im such a brow
guys i had never seen before were fighting me one after another
im past twenty already
and longing for heaven more than anybody
but the strongest people in town now are the dollars right
well its not really a hard job
oriara izaya certainly is an odd name
perhaps her head had separated itself from her body on its own
did the list of illegal immigrants help you yagiri namie sand
various people come and go without being dyed a certain color
apparently this city is made of jokes coincidences and whims
to stomp on their cell pones
i dont like you
wow you compose music
some rumors are even scarier
you sure theres noting wrong wit im
wat should we do
here in tis city id experienced something i couldnt even have dreamed of
its said that theyre working behind the scenes with the awakusu group
or maybe you ope tat sell never come out of it
my love didnt waver at all
you must undergo toe ordeal mikado
o ill tell you beforehand to avoid any misunderstandings
you seem to be attempting quite an interesting approach against the head
he fell in love wit someone wo as neither a heart nor a body
and one girl ere as peered into those cracks
a hint of anxiety roused troug my mind
those are just promises and leibnizs pre established harmony we live in reality
altoug tat makes me feel a little sad
a dream
tisis from the dollars leader isnt it
but they actually disappeared due to a dispute wit another team
s sorry
the rebellious age would be more accurate
speaking of wick havent they stuck out too much recently
we still really need you
they dont try and expand their influence by getting more people wearing the same color
the police wont even come
a mysterious girl
is something wrong
isnt tat like being a deity
will we never ear tat praise from kaztano again
to the north theres a large pleasure quarter
yea in name only
lots of people meet offline to commit suicide right
so your friend was ospitalized
im tired of everyone acting all big in our territory
and on the same night the demon sword saika was trying to love a certain girl
all you can do is live off of someone else you parasite
five years ago saika disappeared
but maybe you should go to a hospital or the police
im interested in the values you have about this world as a dullahan
to escape the shadow etats ceasing der
and the truth behind tis city tat bulges wit desire
and everyone was happy
how much do you believe in coincidence amie
a new city
just call it west gate park
a black bike
luck sure doesnt last very long
everyone knows tat my sister was defeated
he couldve found out sonoara anris address by just taking a look at the class list
togussano its morning ritual time
you need some time to cool down when you lead messed up lives like we do
its the greatest honor for you to embrace me like tis
hey yagiri wat in the world
they decided tat they wanted to study her body first before her head
well get crushed by the police
woa tat voice is tis dotacin
thats the only way to do a good job of separating fiction from reality
ten my current self wit complete disregard for my feelings or the situation
the strongest in this city would be
we dont mind killing you right ere
youre always welcome to talk to me
wat a nostalgic expression
there was a gaping my memory
a simple information dealer such as myself isnt tat evil
and sonoara anris uneventful everyday life should have returned to her as well
but ten there was tat night when fifty people got slashed
it is said tat there are usually only female dullaans
of course your father did something terrible but tat person isnt much better
are you telling me that youll severe the head just because you want it
big brother and rukawa kun both will get points
its rebound
the third lesson has already started
hanamichi plays better against strong opponents
sorry for giving you so much trouble
what kind of a foul was that
first of all who would want to practice with the gorki
which part of him is acute that little punk
nice shoot
shoyos players other than fujima are cm and above
but i had already committed fouls
no your big brother he
height cm weight keg position center
youre too stupid you idiot
that means shohoku wants to win this match
incredible
i wont let that rukawa be better than me
well then lets have a match between the freshmen against the seniors
strict
sakuragi what a coincidence
im the only one
are you alright
what no way
i can still remember it clearly
of course
im getting more and more nervous
this ends todays extra class
coach
idiot how can the star of the team say such a thing
my what a complicated relationship
its definitely different when i was a player
so cold
that idiot he really hit him
i cant just sit and watch after all
sakuragi kun brother why do they start again
changing player
but for him this is a big improvement
go gorilla oh no i mean captain akagi
this is a very important place to me
thats right this amazing defense
why damn it
in order to repay yohei and the others for being such good friends
shut up
i even got my big brother to teach me
he was here a minute ago
i wont run or hide
alright
or am i wrong
right now the team moral is very high
for all you know your bones may also be injured
just one more and he will be fouled out
in a nutshell akagi swan is someone who really loves basketball oak
but i really like this kind of perseverance
defense get ready for rebound
its like hes given everything to basketball
by your own abilities
darn it its hard being a basketball player
i really have high hopes
just wait your turn
the games opponent is my brother
finally he no longer could hide his feelings towards playing basketball
h how charismatic
why do we have to clean up the basketball room during lunch time hanamichi
i thought he was just a dumb jerk
he actually practices the lay up by himself in the morning
nowhere im just practicing with the rest
traveling
this is year two
i definitely cant lose to shoyo
hmm i wonder if my brother will somehow lose to rukawa kun today too
ah but i wonder if youll mind if we practice together
captain
this woman must be one of gorillas subordinates
basketball
freshman class takenori akagi graduate from kitamura
what do you expect from someone like him
and its not my turn yet
i sakuragi am a peacemaker
thats right
who the hell are you
just sometime back didnt my brother lose sakuragi kun by a freak chance too
just you wait
well done kaku
so what if i have fouls
indeed what a living legend
the match is soon
and i think that way too
hey popes its best that he didnt play use your power
then you dont want these pictures of haruko chain
idiot that type of person can be easily easily gotten rid of
we need to change players
oh i believe in you sakuragi
coach by the looks of it its going to be a really good match tomorrow
you were born to become a judo master
it always turns out like this in the end
alright
shut up you old gorilla
thats natural
sakuragi dont you want these pictures
okay this time
dreams high tension
great
regarding the lay up i should be able to teach you at least something
whats wrong with the gorilla today
fighting isnt difficult
give me those pictures
im not talking about things like that
thats right
thats right
i cant believe that shohokus gotten this strong
defeat shoyo and enter the finals
captain
hanamichi has become really serious too
that is a miracle
then again its probably just coincidence
i hate wearing a helmet
thats right
okay score one more basket play hard
thats no good
this is our first and most important match of the year
its him that red head
every time i think of how shohokus akagi sans completely defeated uozumi sand
rukawa kun are you alright
hanamichi not only displayed unbelievable strength and jumping ability
i didnt admit you as one of the team
wait then you dont want these pictures
it wasnt easy to last even this long
here i go sakuragi
were just going to play some basketball
big brothers going too far sakuragi kuns a beginners
your ace
one shot
at that time i was so happy
i ought to stop them but im scared
damn it
okay okay captain
a three pointer
idiot
no one is going to block you
towel
basket counts one foul shot
even on the day of the final match he was late because he overslept
where is banana
ah leaving so soon youhei kun
sakuragi kun i heard you were pretty active during yesterdays match
shut up
come on red head
since you already have enough height and jumping power
at this time they have started showing their ability as a strong team
basket counts
i think so too
one more time
i couldnt shoot very well so i was a bit frustrated
okay lets practice
lets not fight anymore okay
damn it you didnt get any points
points we still have a chance
yes thats right
nice block
ooh its really clean here its wonderful
yesterday was very memorable moment your first official foul out
what a great feeling
at that time the match between ryonan and takezato
its the real one
practice started already hurry up and go
i really dont want to give them up
he isnt playing basketball because he likes it
you still dont understand were in the middle of a match lets go
i gave up hope of winning
okay we will concentrate our attack on the inner court
what i dont want you to teach me whatever boring trick it is
starting from my very first year
nice shot
well whats wrong red head
its not your turn yet
so they are not that weak
im oak
we wanted the practice match
but this two are really tall
damn why is it always me who sits in the corner
even rukawa kun when he first started he was pretty bad too im sure he was
free throw three shoots
thats exactly right
yesterdays game was really something
but i do admit my brother is a little scary
idiot
who are you
no its still too early for me
aota is the smallest guy in the class
this is great what a come back
so gorki is not too bad after all
what a mess
today the time for genius sakuragi to officially complete is closing in
he was given a nickname by others known as white hair demon
that read head is going to play
its not my problem
but with such a strange headful of red hair do the girls really like that
yes it is
but im very surprised that you got up so early to practice sakuragi kun
damn it
this is not good that kind is too nervous
theres no one in the world that can possibly knows how to do it from the beginning
right thats slam drunk
just wait you big gorilla
a slam drunk
why is a coarse guy like that is haruko chains big brother
as a human being he has some problems in there too
hes nothing special and has a bad temper
and even placed himself as the captain controlling all the other gorillas
nice cut
now well start the match kakuno against shohoku
i know him hes some freshman gangster
the other fouls is just a matter of time
captain
hikouichi i told you already we wont lose
that gorilla is the team captain
to be the countrys champion this has been your pet phrase since junior high
alright be careful defending
what a beautiful form
its him again
theyre still points behind
slam drunk
what the hell are you guys doing out there
okay lets start practicing
in front of our coach watch your manners
alright
thats right
a miracle
dont be stupid monkey
i cannot lose at this point
i wasnt blaming you
really
this has gone far enough what are you people thinking anyway
but its okay if it was just that
but i think you sakuragi kun would have no problem at all
am i mitsui hisashi really down that low
sakuragi calm down its okay
get off my way you monkey
rukawa kun i also graduated from tomigaoki
yes i must record it
so what
are you alright
how was that
how come im the only one that has to train in the corner
its my first time to witness such a strong fighter
just let me do them is that so hard
i never thought you would do something like this
sakuragi theres something i want to teach you
how much does a pair cost
i beg of you please tell your people to leave mitsui sand
i think he was only being a little too rash just now he didnt mean what he said
as long as he keeps on training he might become a really good player
i can feel the danger in the air
hold it right there
wheres the gym
but it looks like hes hurt badly this time
since he get fouled during make a point shoot
wait that number where have i seen him before
learning a fighting skill would be the most suitable for him
no if she sees me then she dont think i succeed because im a genius
did you say so what
ignores that idiot
what nonsense you were already late for school
by using this then it can be solved
okay lets try a running shot
to get in the best eight
what you brat
what are you laughing at sendo
i knew it its really sakuragi sand
is this what i am now
no way it looks bad
weve become then black horse that everybody is looking out for
of course hes the one who dunked on someones head
in the first half they are still at to ending with an point difference
big brother can you teach me the trick to doing a lay up
no matter how i look at him that block of wood will never be tense and uneasy
you idiot
hey stop it you two
sakuragi kun are you alright
are my classes are that boring foi
hey ref pushing hes pushing
thank you so much for supporting slam drunk all this while
it wasnt your fault uozumi i can still play
didnt you make a promise tat youll definitely become a saint before going home
o yea sasha
you underestimated albaficas pride and tenacity
wat did you do to the owners of these cloths
did you know
foolish atena
how are the defenses coming along
your red
were the neck is e
how foolish even if e succeeds
the place were swindlers and thieves end up
tis is the border between the underworld and the land of the living
the colors tat umans perceive are merely illusions created by the reflection of light
its such a deep mountain
but it should take a long time for tat big blockhead to burn away
however everyone is anxious
enough lets end tis
the sky as turned into a canvas
the world will belong to shades
fools
im not suited for tat kind of occasion
tat cosmo
both of their cosmos are radiating over ere
your skills exceeds rumors
wait ill finish tis guy in just a moment
are you going back to the libra house
the specters and shades
the only one wo can stop im is you is old friend
go to the mountain snort of the city
o way
be still for now
my senses are fading
let the saints have a taste of your power
youre a bunch of fools for trying so hard
looks like the maintenance of the barrier is taking a toll on her
youre useful since youre an old friend of shades vessel
it really is
subjugation of the celestial demon
change the living world into a peaceful and serene world of death
it cant be even after absorbing so much of the deep fragrance
as i tougt
hurry up and defeat tat gold saint on the tower
im glad
im surprised tat youre still alive
can your black flames keep up wit the next great horn
even if it doesnt make you sleep the special sockwave will still affect your nerves
these fruits
the guardian dog of the underworld cerberus
those roses are a terror
thats why i say the mask is a pain
wit your dinky power its impossible to break free of my worms
i cant ear any of your nonsense
because youre not evil
the stars are shifting rapidly
atenas love as no meaning to me
you ask if i plan to kill sasha
thats right sasha
they should be going to the gates of the underworld
the deaths of saints still make lady atena sad
right ere right now lord shades as been completely resurrected
even after wat the priest told me
the six parts of rebirth
welcome specters
the place were one can only enter wit permission from the gods
whats the point of living wit sadness and pain
sell be worried about alone too
its like an universe presiding in my body
its probably because of you
its all because of the elder
lord aldebarans late
in exchange for all of asmitas cosmo
itll subdued your senses
lady atenas love gives us ope
looks like you have a difficult foe today
thank you yato
please do not worry
it might be too early for celebrations
youre an interesting one
ill tell you the details later
come back from the tranquility of death the eternal peace
however i cant miss out on such a good opportunity
the ultimate cosmo
the elder asked me to assist you thats why
a cosmo
everything
its fine
he isnt dead yet
wat do you think of im
a specter appeared out of nowhere
together let us
the roses have a pleasant smell
so tat we wont lose to the enemy
theres no way tat sasha wont be worried about our ometown
to me youre the only one wo matters
you have to inherit is legacy
roses are condemned to a life of solitude because of tat
wit tis you wont be able to withstand my corona blast
as expected of a gold saint
everyones going towards the same direction
as expected of the strongest warriors in all of atenas saints
look es calling for you
im glad were unarmed
yes and lead im towards you
please give us the orders to attack
tat little girl is atena
lives at the call of my fingers
it must be due to atenas barrier
pegasus saint
when we return to our world we must see lady atena wit gig spirits
its okay hes definitely alive
i can feel her prayers for pegasus in tat strong cosmo
its dark already
its okay if my pain continues
i know theyre praying for me
the specters i defeated must have revived
is just someone wo is easily affected by emotions and utterly reckless
you wanted to watch over me
father
it was probably made by lady atena went se was young
for the sake of justice and love on tis earth
stand by me
you really came back as a saint like you promised
perhaps the pisces gold saint
damn you
the whole world will be covered by a peaceful darkness
but one day
faint it so
it would be great if we could damage its tree heads at once
bennu kagao of the celestial violence star
do you want to use tat power and passion for the sake of many more people
hey why are you so beaten up
ill go take a look at the state of the river
so wat is it
you have just become a saint
thats right shades
so you came all tis way from the zodiac houses for a fight
end the saints
tat bracelets on your wrist
outing good ever comes out from being involved wit you
youve become a crafty old scoundrel
you people had no chances of winning right from the start
but her brother alone as now become shades
hes not good enough
im very sorry but youll end up just like albafica
just like im
were warriors of the dead you know
to think tat you were there when shades attacked
the two gods will be pleased
of course i wouldnt let you destroy it
ill get pegasus and escape quickly
wat are the names of the bronze saints wo died
would you roll up your right sleeve
so wat
thats right
dont go
atenas saints will never find im
damn you
cat sit cesire of the terrestrial bestial star
specters of the underworld
even tough you have learned about your sin noting you do now will change things
the praesepe is a cluster of blue stars wick link tis world to the underworld
altoug were still small and cant do the things we want to do
you idiot
the death of my ometown
those black flames are full of denial and hostility
it means you disappear
tat painting is said to be so beautiful tat even sinners
how much more is e going to refined it
after becoming a saint of atena
even someone as powerful as you came back wit suck serious injuries
look at the flower bracelets on is right wrist
you collapsed on the mountain pat
hold on lets follow im
father could something have happened to lord albafica
it is my hobby to enjoy the cries of women and girls
the sockwaves emitted from tis surplice arent just normal sockwaves
is e really going to take part in the holy war
a dark abysmal cosmo
from now on im yuzuria of the crane
wat a foolish man
a man known as the great sinner of heaven
o please fight them on your own
tis cosmo is abnormal
youre right
its not like i wanted the specters to resurrect anyway
tenma are you okay
youll face me personally
looks like you still have the will to fight
looks like the current commander of the army isnt lord shades
my soul
please be safe
you spout nonsense
submerged the world in the quiet darkness
our fight was an illusion
tis way is heart will be free of turmoil
whats tat evil spirits
your men will die
they can suppress the immortality of shades army
yet es late for practice
hey you hand the dog over
im scared
to me specters and saints are noting
ive gotten rid of tat big blockhead aldebaran
if the two gods knew
fools do they expect to stop us wit tease torns
of course we know tat you have already dealt wit im
and the universe within me is telling me
we could smile again
whats so special about tat tree
you probably feel tat way because you have been protecting her since se was young
how can an attack from your subdued fist get troug
o yea hey yato
o way
its true tat toe specters are gathering in italy
you bastard
the saints will become mere puppets in my hands
right now the only one wo can do tat is
hes a priest from the forest cathedral
the elder is waiting inside
even so gramps
come ill play wit you
are you going to attack tis village too
but right now ses just an ordinary girl wo as yet to awaken as atena
but we cant leave your little brother alone
thats right young one
the concerns about pegasus are over
universe
yes i expected gold saints to be strong
dont want you to get hurt onii can
the saints wo protect the land wont go down tat easily
hes from the orphanage too
the holy war as begun
i dont like unnecessary fights
well meet in the world of the living next time pegasus
but its not all bad
are you ere to avenge pisces
or tat e can converse wit budda
atenas love as no meaning to me
atenas sword must have protected you
insolent saints of atena
damn it
lady atenas prayers
tat cosmo
your fight for your friends and for your promises tat truth of yours ends ere
ill strike from the shadows he wont know wat it im
poisoned by the accursed human earth
tat is a tranquil color a color of salvation
o way
minoes of the celestial nobility star will remain dead
thats right
but thats human nature
you risked your life and became a human
we live to protect love and justice in the land
but im not trying to run away from tis war
i went to see atena thats all
for the sake of your friends
how tat your arm is hurt you cant old your stance anymore
lets go
the ultimate cosmo is needed
im yuzurika a warrior from jamir
from now on the army will keep on coming after you
in tis sera atena did not descend upon her statue
but its good to have extra help from a capable one
his golden air and become black
your movement will be hindered
in order to turn tease fruits into weapons
i took a chance on you thats all
hell be swamped in horror and despair by tanatos
its my greatest dream to look at tat painting in person
make the world a peaceful and serene place
along wit toe resurrection of the pegasus saint
youre a vile one
have you heard of the essence of the cosmo
looks like youve said your farewells
i apologize for my late arrival
damn it we wont let you enter the sanctuary damned specter
altoug yuzuria doesnt have a cloth
tat my blood as become poison itself
thats wat the elder said
but it doesnt seem like youll listen
since the age of myt
we have things to do
ill make you scream mandrakes
he lives in the orphanage just outside town
indeed just recently i could clearly sense a huge cosmo tat resembled tat of shades
is tat the village wick lord minos was talking about
i have urgent news
we have just returned from italy
my attacks are the fastest among all the gold saints
all the peoples souls will be bound to tis painting
indeed shades is being resurrected in our ometown
take of them and go
good timing
well just be abandoned when the time comes right
these charms are from atena in the last holy war
you and better not be afraid of one or two gold saints
im ere by lady pandoras orders
tis is too ridiculous
its my turn now
dont surprise me like tat
you can break my arms crush my legs
saints did you think youd get troug so easily
and you subconsciously refined your cosmo to its limits
dont let anyone but the enemy near me
my name is aldebaran
would you cover the sky and the earth wit tis color for me
fine ten
its okay im just going to ask them to open the gates
do you have some business at the virgo house atena
o way tenma
cant underestimate specters
let me teach you some manners
and the ope inside is earth
o way
itll be too late for regrets after you die
weve defeated the saints tat were stationed ere
tat holds true for adults as well as children
how naive
when people live together
you can get help from there
its good to get along well like tis but its a waste of time
yes we just have to wait for im to awaken fully
do you think i cant fight without stem
you have to keep on going while remembering your friend
youre so weak
the heavenly darma wheel otherwise known as the truth of the universe
well meet again
rozan hyakuryu ha
asmita wat do you think of tenma
losing one or two fists its noting
a woman
i only have one strut
it was made wit countless prayers
as promised
however its common courtesy to introduce yourself
wat he cut troug my worms
i could feel the cosmos belonging to you tree
the sweet aroma penetrates your skin and paralyzes your senses
the advent
these black flames will burn you to a crisp
his arm is moving on its own
sow me ten
yea its a promise
the strongest of the tree judges in all of the evil stars
and found a suspicious cathedral in the forest
w wait
my friend
my body
but even if youre not a saint and not on the battlefield
you engulf enemies and people you want to protect in flames
whos tat woman
but going alone
a real horrible place
but even i couldnt
damn ill remember tis
you should take better care of your body
whats tat light
the body of the human wit the purest soul of tis erza
i mean virgo asmita
know your place
its probably ere to feind against intruders
you really came saint of atena
tis is the end for you taurus
the forest cathedral
tis cosmo is
lord aldebaran is badly hurt
wat the neck is tis mission etats supposed to affect the outcome of the holy war
they oppose toe surplices wick are made from underworld minerals
the training of saint candidates is always so intense
ell become as dead as stem
just like a bird in a cage
i wont let you get in is way
sadness
could it be our ometown
right kagao
especially you
altoug albafica managed to push shades army back
pegasus cosmo is singing more brightly
you spout nonsense
its foolish of you to cling onto human memories
but war is scary
tis mist is spreading too quickly
its too late you idiot
the strongest trio in all of shades army unnamed the tree judges of hell
in other words your move depends on speed
youll definitely save everyone
you must be the saint of pegasus
you dont seem to have gardens like tat of albafica
in such deep mountains i can actually feel a small non specter cosmo
wit tis you want to become an atenas saint
tis way please
i dont understand you at all
the cildood promise is my motivation
the specter twos able to defeat the pisces gold saint
we dont know when theyll resurrect again
the place were the greedy receive their punishment after dealt
the living cannot enter the underworld
ill protect the world and sasha
its time
i will kill you
a are you an idiot
a white rose stained red by albaficas poisonous blood
a painting drawn wit fabricated colors how would it stir anyones earth
lord shades is already in an unreacable place
blood went
face arm legs destroy whatever you like
explain wat you did tis time
the elder of jamir probably wants those
im yato sama the person closest to being a saint ere
tat idiot
you dont belong in is army
those are just like surplices underworld cloths
welcome back tenma
but we have a gold saint ere
surely
wat an incredible fellow
ill fight you myself ten
how could you do tat to a woman
tenma youre saying strange stuff again
hes so overpowering
how will you fight against so many of us
surely you arent ere by chance
if thats the extent of your powers
are you next little one
if we become saints can we be wit you
a foolish goddess
tat bracelets is infused wit lady atenas prayers
lady atenas mind and body have reached their limits
have you cleared your doubts asmita
have no intention of changing my beliefs tat the world is full of suffering and confusion
tat young man wo was chosen as shades vessel
do you think flames like these will keep me away
shades prepare yourself
hes just a bronze saint
there is a limit to the colors wick umans can create
in fact lady pandora is the one commanding the army right now
wat do you mean by tat
sorry for talking so much
lord shades is currently alone concentrating on the lost canvas
tat rose are you related to pisces
thats because you havent understood the principles of destruction
atena can only pray for our safety no matter wat happens
ill draw everything in tis world onto tis lost canvas
were being manipulated by these strings
he must have finished tons of paintings already
lets laugh together again
about tat i have an important message from the elder
you must always have the strength and kindness to protect the weak
you were the one wo ruined the town
the truth of tis girl wo wants to protect the land ends ere
for the next generation
youve been sprouting nonsense from the start
cover the land wit darkness
its in the direction of the town
the bloody mist became needles
we have been fighting for centuries
its too late
hes so fussy about manners
shades army is probably moving out already
our enemies might be more than just specters
all of you shall end up like im
as expected of lord minos
her barrier was erected to seal toe undying abilities of the specters
youre just a bronze saint
calling me a bastard
if you keep going out like tat the pope will worry
in other words these are the life energies of the saints
it cant be
or even smash my face
yuzuria should have told you tat toe specters are immortal
wat do you think kagao
its likely tat you wont be able to give it back to im directly
my name isnt important
alone everyone
come on lets get the mukurossi fruits already
protect pegasus
fool take tis
teleportation
dont worry agasa
the protection tat lord shades gives us is very strong you know
their poison is ineffectives against me
friends
the banks of hell
my paintings have lost their spirit
damn it
tis burning cosmo
yea i tougt some souls or specters lost their way again
why did you murder your good friend
ill finish you wit the next move
as long as someone inerits our will
because in tis world nobody is truly evil
right now lady atena and the pope are preparing the troops
whats wit your anxious looks
yet se close to be reincarnated as a human and undergo suffering
whos there
we might not be able to help much now
your friend dumbass
great sinner of heaven god slayer
hes tenmas good friend alone
lord albaficas roses are being blown into the sky
it seems tat your heart still contains tougts of the human alone
youll be a great man
the one on the fire clock
however i will never let you pass
my body its
when tat time comes all lives in the world will be annihilated
ignite your cosmo unicorn
in fact lady pandora is the one commanding the army right now
for now we must find the pat wick leads to the deepest part of the underworld
hes just a bronze saint right now
now you have to start all over again
the great bloody waterfall
its an unstable world were good and evil is uncertain
ill give everyone in tis world the peace of death
as a soul if you lost your five senses
didnt i just defeat you guys
wat a great disappointment
right now asmita is refining is cosmo in order to purify toe beards
yes but im not hindered in any way
for the sake of lady atena
sow me your strut now
winner tenma
and attain true happiness
its been a long time since i gave my all
tis light
emotional jot blooded and very human right
in addition two bronze saints are tougt to be dead
wat a pitiful soul
a tremendous amount of energy flows out from my body
by the way youve been ere for a few months already
leave tis to me
maybe its a mysterious power arising from asian blood
hes a freak wo takes painting lessons at the city curc
o i didnt mean tat
it looks like the village and the sanctuary are safe
but even lord aldebaran gets hurt sometimes
anyway its not real training wit only you as an opponent
ill destroy everything
before you fall into ell let me tell you something good
we need someone wo can attain a level on par wit tat of the mukurossi
its not the time for a decisive battle
he went wit lord doko to deal wit toe specters right outside the sanctuary
get out of my sight and reflect on your actions
he was badly wounded and wasnt in any scape to fight
deep iobe of the terrestrial darkness star
theres no need to grieve
too bad
ten mandrakes wo we defeated earlier
after tat go back to the houses wit stem
wat should we do ten
to think tat e can use corona blasts at one time
ill send you to ell right ere right now
asmita the blind saint
the painting wick alone did two years ago
o doko
fighting alone
it was a promise between the tree of us remember
ive been painting everyday
ive always bated my own blood and lived in solitude
could it be
theyre but a sort lived dream
even if death or anything else might await us
ill carry you as many times as you want
it must have been a mistake
weve lost the chance for alone to become human again
theres no end
the wound tat kagao inflicted on me opened
they can be used as weapons to seal toe souls wick toe surplices protect
i caused alone to turn into shades
if you wish to seek the real colors
its glistening as if it was newly made
theres no other way out
sorry
are you alrigt alone
did alone shades order tis
alone are you awake
finally the anticipated resurrection of the lord of the underworld
its hard to maintain the cosmo continuously wit no rest
im deadly beetle stand of the celestial ugliness star
we have to leave quickly
the flower bracelets of prayer
youre stronger than you look
troug toe fights so far
ive given you much trouble
theres something wrong wit tis waterfall
im on my way
because of tat lord shades couldnt resurrect us
whats tis mist surrounding the roses
you have beautiful clear eyes
one of the peerless gold saints
you and beemot violate lay in my shadow to watch over me
the eadless woman cants the words of death
is it okay asmita
ill blow you bastards away along wit tis village
im feeling quite happy right now
o one can withstand tease toxic roses
else youll be discovered by the specters
tis is so ridiculous
refining and exploding the universe within us otherwise known as the cosmo
but not fast enough
but we will become saints
to keep the promise tat was made two years ago
how do you know its me if you have your eyes closed
change the world wit me
but also by your enemies like me
one wo is it by tis
the dirty streets
yea the silver saints should be ere to help soon
you fool
wit their fists they split the sky and scatter the earth
gold saints
so tis is your strategy to sway lord shades
desertion is punisable by death
he stopped my corona blast wit is arms folded
it wasnt easy to make im lie down
tis is jamir the place were lifeless cloths are revived
and tis too tis current world isnt an illusion
to rule the world
daisy
wat does tis mean
is school fun
its unfortunate tat se violated orders
i want
still my predictions augur good fortune
her key
yea but theyre best suited for it in terms of ability
and remember wat you wished for back ten
we cannot keep the worlds former dictator waiting
well it doesnt matter
forget about tat lets go in
lieutenant francs coming up on amakusa
tat was an accident
but my key broke and i dont know wat to do
i didnt do anything but her sword just
my resolve will rule tis fragmenting world
jealousy
second lieutenant kurenai abandoned the mission
but the targets just a child
tat can turn a persons wisp into a supernatural power
if you dont get her treated soon sell die
my mother burned to death in tat fire

im like a wish granting fairy
if you dont furry se will die

h how are you safe
and ive been hiding the truth
yesterday i moved to the floor above
and tis lies directly above it
but my predictions are more accurate colonel

self interest lies at the core of everyones wins
an order is capable of turning is or her wish into great power
u wat
is tat daisy is a being
daisy why did you appear before me again
sergeant wat are we supposed to do
i meant if you were an order
it should prevent you from losing control like ten years ago

im wearing tigts theres noting to be embarrassed about
but thats a distant memory
but you looked really acute

on the night of the tokyo explosion
just wat are contractors waits so fun about them
can you even feel pain
either swords nor guns will affect im

im escaping
unknown substances and unexplainable phenomena manifest themselves near the gates
a light was set free
theyre complete blockeads as soldiers and weapons
and youre august t the man called the magician
a it wasnt on purpose tough it was just a coincidence an accident
the priority order is simon toe professor and the data
a right
thats why i swore id protect simon

the invocation an uninvited spell
theyre not after me

ill be taking tat young man
so you have someone you like
there are no tricks or gimmicks
as long as you dont lose it well be sure to meet again one day
well be taking im into our custody so theres no need to worry
is tat wat being a rational contractor is about
tat organization as finally made a move in its desire for izanagi
the stars in the sky are the very lives of contractors
ses a mere human twos absolutely unnecessary to me
burdened by the fate known as sin
so wat tis isnt a macro leans
wat do you think petya
as the light of the sun wanted at dusk
why are you ere simon
therell be a house search by the fsb in two days
theres eleven times more quinoline in the secondand smoke taen wat you inhale

there are several times in your life when your world changes overnight
someone confessed to tanya today
the sky we see now is fabricated
a distraction
youll just get hurt if you dont understand tat
slowly and quietly
july do you know were e is
i heard tat some dead stock was found in the back of tis bar
hazuki preparations are complete
tat wont be needed
how was your match wit your father
i can say tat for sure
the unified consciousness of us umans and the stars
day in and day out from tis same window always tis same view
i guess your type doesnt flock together
i tougt it might be a boring choice
dont avez dreams about granted normal happiness
here you go some tea
kokuto do you know anything about the ogawa mansion in kayamiama
but why werent you satisfied wit just staring at the world outside
youre going to see your come for the first time in half a year
i can tell by the look on your face tat youre worried about something
i dont know
why dont you get back to the judo club
there are two types of escape
into the future
if i could save everyone by dying
id say tat the difference between us is our priorities
lets meet one story up
im not interested in someone ive already killed once
the key is the proof tat we are a family
i saw four young guys messing wit a girl in a kimono
i want to love more
my reason is long forgotten
he could be at the bottom of tokyo bay by now
you the personality
to find and eliminate a magus wo uses fairies
the truth is none of them really intended to die
one two tree
of course and you are real
there wasnt even a drop of blood
its widely known tat you are totally into ryogi
by the way i havent been able to find siki
a sounds like the secret weapon as arrived safely
and all the students in class
isnt the moon very beautiful tonight
ever dreaming thinking of noting forever
but se used to be completely normal
im weak so i cant do wat se said
i told you not to look for me
i have orders from miss toko aozaki to be ere
seniors say tat the rate of employment is good
its fine now while is personality as sirazumi lion still remains
o se hasnt been come or back to the dorm
i had a feeling tat id run into you
azaka worked really armd tis time so it must be a treat
why are you keeping it a secret from the police
sooner or later a time will come when se will be able to acknowledge herself as siki
i and my uncle adopt me as is daughter
you told me last summer at broad bridge
you could say tat lines of death are the seams of objects
so was anyone we met today suspicious siki
you were talking about coming to my school
so you tested without lessons
are you in pain
can i take it as a declaration of hostility
my family matters are irrelevant ere
not so far
besides if ses really my apprentice sell manage
shiki was a personality tat only knew murder
do you understand now
dual existence
i actually
bloodthirsty killers dont need any reasons
but still the view didnt change
because i want you to
you dont carry the same pain tat siki folds
but enjou is the one wo brought you your ruin
if youre wit gakuto ill make it per pack for yea
outing tat the police could use as evidence
by the way did you ear
i cant trouble you or tomoe
all right ten ill have to use force
ten our intelligence is nothingness as well
anything and everything
you were controlling two different bodies wit one mind
i wont start acting violently out of the blue
during is interview e couldnt take is eyes off the dolls
after all we have to celebrate your recovery ill bring someone good how does tat sound
the only one wo can protect per wants her dead
most people dont lead tat kind of life because they want it
one a monster should not talk
ive come to see you because im running out of time
resorting to force
you must be the boy from yesterday
wat you pissed cause im like an our late
intelligence born from activity in the brain develops into a personality
if it were the sea just before daybreak
my family wasnt bad enough to deserve dying like tat
tomorrow for sure
as their petals scatter across the blue sky
vision is not wat our eyes we gaze at
and eternity ends
in the end it fell to the ground exhausted
how can you move in tat body of yours
theres an academy in london
me and my outer selfs dream
at tat point the personality roused in the physical body loses all purpose
you should be careful mr kokuto
into the future
starting today all extracurricular activities have been canceled
so thats why youre dressed like tat
tis brings the number of victims in mifune city up to seven
but i couldnt find the person to kill
the small roles on each side are antitetical spirals conflicting wit each other
the origin wont take scape unless you awaken it
but id imagine is death was caused by emorragic shock
yea i knew
tis may be my last chance to have a normal conversation
others need to think im normal or else its over for me
its a microcosm so to speak
i wanted someone just like me
well head toward our future
rather its wat our brain compreends and registers
please stay by my side
i repeat the same answer i gave her tat day
se isnt normal
look a peaceful love is about to begin
dont you think you might be a bit too self conscious
its all right ive already determined the method
se looked as if se was always scared of something
its an easy trick im switcing my personality based on my field of vision
there wont be any more for a while
he started out not even having any contact information for me but managed to wind up ere
o youre awake
im separate from the two personalities wo were born inside tis body
the one thing tat seems natural to us
to tell you the truth its hard for me right now
the siki wo affirms everything so as not to get hurt
youll see true sorrow spread its wings at last
its past our appointed time of one oclock
now im scared of people
i go see her in the hospital every saturday afternoon
as a form of self defense
your brother is on the prone
well i guess thats the conclusion theyd draw
a piece of skin was collected from under the female victims nail
peoples memories no their traces
tree its meaningless if the monster can die
id always tougt tat my life was empty
since i can see tat siki is fond of you
but to think tat they would obtain a body to get past the field
how many times have i told you
well if youre referring to our conversation yesterday
you lied to yourself saying its natural for the abnormal to do abnormal things
whats the meaning of tis
a lot of people from tis school are supposed to go to college right
im sorry to say tis but im sure itll be fatal
we kill someone at least once in our lifetime
my personal accounts for sikis repressed tougts
fujino asagamis pain still remains inside her
understood you are the first one
do you mind
wat are you looking at im not gonna sacre wit you
sit it wouldve been much easier if youd been a witness
if tis bloodthirsty killer really exists
a miraculous female student at my gig school
he said the corpses arms and legs were cut off and left there
i said tat id carry your sins in your place
didnt i tell you ill bear it in your place
i really dont want to kill people
their own insecurities drove them to die on the spur of the moment
spirits normally dont avez tat level of intelligence
ill make sure your new left and can grab on to a spiritual body
well i dont know
the second victims body was split into two calves
sadly you were never able to express your true feelings
we had a farewell party for an upperclassman
everyones so weird
so im sure well try to kill each other the moment we meet
is to kill me
yes wat is it
because of your accident two years ago your eyes have become capable of seeing those cracks
anyway tis dragonfly was flying around busily
i believe tat toe spiral might deviated when the same death is repeated million times
kill me and return to your true self
so its you
right its about tat accident
sorry man took me way too long to sake off akitaka
if you have no attachment to the world youre living in
thats a contradiction
her back
its a rule i have from before
at the time fujino tougt se would be stabbed
the third body and its hands and feet cut off
the boy is always dreaming
its because of tis apartment complex you set up
therefore your real question is tis
true wisdom
as wit the other four cases there was no
ryougi in front of you
sikis mystic eyes of death perception were awakened in the accident two years ago
rebelling is wat i want to do most
se was a special channel able to see things differently taen other people
tis cocktail is the new one wit acid and cannabis right
strawberry comes to mind when you think of me
besides tat classroom
you can alter yourself by holding a weapon
thats probably were their so called workshop is
o matter how much i ate it
i cant save anyone
i want to see you
of course
okay so i just need to keep looking down
sikis body is connected to the spiral of origin troug her eyes
theres no reason for suicide
yes but even so there are still a few doubts remaining
konna ni akarui sekai e
holding a lamp close to you
i ope you will have a peaceful dealt
tis years murders have all taken place in the back alleys of downtown
well excuse me if i dont avez mystic eyes like you and miss toko
at tis office i call hollow shrine surrounded wit a mystical barrier to keep people away
tat concludes the evening news for november t
wo knows but i do know the person wo designed tis place
even tough i was more scared of death than anything else
ses not ere
there are secrets within the earth
but since wat we call intelligence comes from the activity in your brain
so it turned out just like how i expected it to
are you sure
but did shiki really die for noting ryougi siki
siki is only supposed to be able to affirm
i could never kill you
oak im all right
such sorrowful scenery into light
because i had never felt pain
i cant fight tis temptation either
but just now i felt tat there might be a tiny bit of meaning
those are people the world call magic
but you called me by tat name
tat concludes the evening news for november t
someone wo was close and important to my brother and me passed away
he got wat e asked for
but no one tried to help her
is my brother ere
when you bleed a massive amount of blood vital activity stops due to oxygen starvation
i was so stupid
its a conventional answer
those were truly dreamlike days
the fact tat you dont see tat means youre crazy about her
thats wat the dead would say
im shiki and the usual ones siki
but it was so got out today
im azaka kokuto from class
thats wat se wants
ever since you lured tat piece of meat out
a dream called the history of tis world
one wo is unfit for living and pleasures herself by coming into contact wit dealt
you were only a letter away from being a lion
everything in tis world as a flaw
o thank you
trying to reach the origin troug the soul
a sadness of bright green
could you search inside the school building one more time
o detective could figure wat appenedit was driver alone in a car on the move after all
everything in existence as cracks
the fairy andler as taken the memory of tis incident away from the students
ever mind just be careful
i know tis is pointless but still
theyre under an old friends name
a female gig school junior living in the city
my story is one of a brave and laudable girl
my daily life is being invaded
i created siki and shiki myself
a monster
its not a matter of intelligence first physical body later
it takes more than a brain tat generates intelligence
so the villagers stayed away from her and arassed der
wat is your name
whats the magus goal
but ill be fine ill wear a jacket too
siki youre a little mad arent you
the girls wo committed suicide all went to different schools and moved in different circles
i want to see you
the you i knew until now
why do you go so far to reach the spiral of origin
se would probably face her actions without evading stem
its not like youre assigned to me exclusively
wat can you understand about me
simply put its wat you call instincts
once you get off the elevator you have apartments troug up front
do you mean murder isnt the fairy andlers intent
because it proved tat touko aozaki indeed existed
it looks like you know everything
it seems alba did more than e should have
all i could do was float after all
the one at the fujo building wasnt me
mr kokuto do you understand tat im a psyco
because you sow me wat i can never have
leaving the misty forest
araya wat do you seek
the ogawa apartment complex is an embodiment of taijitu duality witing one
good bye
you said i wasnt a murderer but
it took place on the last day of summer break on the west side stopping street
dream
of believing into light
so there was noting to you guys scaring an umbrella in the rain
but tis apartment complex is two ten storysemicircular buildings standing next to each other
by the way wat do you mean by se was weird from the get go
instead of choosing our pat based on the sins we bear
one needs entertainment to live
tis is all happening because i granted their wisest
denial is my territory
so ive walked into a huge magical entity
its most likely tat se keeps killing because
the urge you feel when you view the world you live in
youre right
a similarity wick the police have been paying scant attention to
we once completed to reach the origin
self suggestion
se already regained sensitivity to pain by ten
wat do you mean were just friends
i took refuge in im first
siki ryogis body is connected to the origin
tis building is your body
leaving behind one kiss
your strut is noting but a rumor tat came from the students after the incident
and their demolition as been planned for years
but they are popular in europe
the woman wo called herself a counsellor would come every day
the truth as to how ryougi siki was related to the pantom killer murders two years ago
the world may break down
e may start breaking into comes
tat e was gonna get killed or something like tat
i guess theyre secretly getting popular among young people
to spread anxiety among the students at the reien academy
do you believe in a previous life
chance is wat determines weter or not one becomes a victim
and tis caotic impulse is called origin by magic
devouring is certainly a peculiar impulse tough
its too good to be mere chance
even so i want to touch
and had the misfortune of being killed in car accidents
well ill be gone for a little while
being together tough we werent together
the number of fujo building suicide victims as now reacted eight
originally you should have been on my side of the world you know
siki wants to kill everyone wo tries to open her lid
the young lady of the asagami family is a little strange
but there was no reason for shiki to disappear
you cant kill the time of over two hundred years tat ive been alive
fell from the roof of the fujo building wing
how is tat a secret weapon
o so you wont forgive me even if i cry
tell azaka se did a good job
it was the first emotion besides murder tat shiki obtained
se was very religious and kind
being able to see them means understanding the truth about the objects
if you say so fine ill spend the night
just like you yourself used to be
hes known of fujinos ability since cildood
your personality is split in two
they become entwined wit each other and wait at the conflicting spirals
if theres a culprit for all these cases
ill let you pick toe brand
mus fujo was at the time of her death
i guess im siki in your eyes after all
they were all good girls wit no problems at home
tell im one thing for me
siki told me those were her grandfathers last words
a boy like tis wo is attracted to dolls so much
you called just to ask me tat
you could call me an angst ridden maiden
so thats wat it is
of the former fujo building owner the late yasuki fujo
the sense of pain is
and i could wipe out everyone else in tokyo just by being alive
so thats why you took notice of siki
did you receive my message from mother already
the question is wick came first
i cant forgive tis guy wo killed you
when the day comes tat tis body disintegrates into nothingness
mikiya kokuto is my older brother
go see one of them and dump all your problems onto tat person
tis is death
to protect is dream of living happily
i just wanted to make sure
o you are the only heir wo will succeed toe ryogi family
when the emotion you feel towards another person exceeds your capacity
youve been repeating the crime since four years ago
because the memory is vividly recorded inside you
something ugly
or should i say its been reversed
dream
so i tougt you might be able to tell me about it
tat apartment complex is a mechanism set up to contain toe magical experiment within
youre toe culprit
spring will be willed wit sweet and deep fragrances
and in return ill have you help me in my field of work
dream
thats right im not a personality tat my brain dreamed up
as the night deepens the darkness tickens
face your darkness and recall your name
siki u
i cant stay ere any longer
from the second floor and up you cant directly move between the east and west towers
tat monster in there might just be able to defeat me
its not my concern is it
doesnt it go something like our father wo dart in heaven
i dont want to do something a closer would do
se was wit azaka yesterday when i went to see her
the male personality shiki is no longer witing siki
a story of the two
sirazumi lion copse it by is own will
are you going to go see siki again today
in the morning i wake up
i wish you couldve been my ally
se is the complete opposite of siki
mikiya im taking the sword
hur eight
and tat means its not her preference to kill right
so theres a jacket you can wear over a kimono
one can bear the burden of only one persons death in is lifetime
just like asagami fujinos incident
you killed those four guys on monday didnt you
in order to turn siki ryogi into an omnipotent human being
right there was a person floating over the fujo building
wat do you mean by tat gakuto
ten all thats left is to kill the cause
you came because your desire brought you to me right
are you going to see the supposedly dead family
ive killed myself over and over again
he must have been picked on
so ive always killed my own will
but you came into my world without my permission too
but will also never attract anyone
into the water to escape far away
u touko sand
as a matter of fact your eyes are always looking at my death
i dont know why but it doesnt seem fun
tis is now ryougi siki rejected me
ten hayama was
the me in the sky went away you see
the fourth victim was cut into pieces wit some sort of symbol inscribed
how your job is to capture toe suspect if possible
are you sure youre feeling oak
i think it was the other night
head off to tomorrow
so students stay ere even during winter break
i must separate those two as soon as possible
the truth is se was never wounded to begin wit
but thats all there is to it
rather than instill me wit a ready made personality
if so was there anything tat changed her condition
why do i have to be irritated about tis cramp
i want to kill you
do you think someone like me should be left alone
thats wat i expect of ryougi siki
never wishing for yourself to become special
well because im a weak person too
because youre resisting your origin
youve got a precedents so youre forbidden from folding sharp objects
they actually awakened emptiness my origin
rather the physical body comes first and ten intelligence is born
i picked strawberry tonight
of course there is
isnt it just materializing in a dangerous way
youd be well received
theres tis tinge called the collective unconscious tat a famous psycologist defined
adding to the murders four years ago the total is now thirteen
o come on
since went have we realized tat unidentified beings were just strangers
im going to look into fujino asagamis past
robbed by a fairy
but se learned wat pain was
as you know our school motto is freedom
why would se let just a classmate call her by her first name
august am
the mistake is deeply hidden
why were you attracted to ryougi siki
it wont become a different flower simply by changing the soil it grows in or the water it drinks
were alive
a dream
the young male victims were often seen ranging around ere
but the other flavors dont fit my image of you
excuse me as an escort you have to wait ere
it lasts about four ours or so
makes you turn a side of your face up towards the sky
and the entire world love you unconditionally
its like a new religious cult
it abandoned the me wick was still inside my box
tis is reality
even tough they just recently finished vacating all of their tenants
wit per abilities shed be invincible
widely known
siki tat injury
but it will be ruined upon contact
there was a real blade mixed in wit toe fake little cooking utensils
you shouldnt kill im
thats right tat was sikis nature
i dont even need to answer tat
se learned wat dealt felt like
whats your name
whats your goal
am i going crazy
so now did those two see the illusion of these yet non existent fairies
thanks for your hard work
he entrusted me wit tis
like you guessed those four guys wo were killed were all cocktail users
created it believing tat it comes from intelligence instead
from tat day on siki started completely ignoring me
there arent any small abnormalities so you dont notice the major ones
you see i love the view from tis window
but if you meet resistance go ahead and kill
the sound of steam
i dont know
family registries of people wo died years ago were refused and forged
doesnt tat make us one and the same existence
tat makes six
the ogawa apartment complex is a very big end building even for the kayamiama district
a familiar figure is walking ahead in the distance
the spiral of origin
yea i get tat a lot
would you at least keep tat door locked
you were always one but someone gave you a second container
nobody killed anyone
he quit saying there was something else eyd prater do
so my story ends ere
it makes me want to vomit thinking se may kill again
so im going to try to come as close to it as possible
my tears tat i id drop in crimson
id forgotten about it for a long time
your powers of suggestion wont work on me
your house is right there
tat pains me
right but i sympathize wit der
ses really scary
ses really lost a lot of blood
i dont think itll get too bad
one wo as an awakened origin by escaping to death
to the scenery of love yet to be seen
you dont condone murder regardless of the reason right
the only thing connecting the two buildings is the elevator lobby in the center
cause keitas friends got killed one after another you know
tecnically for the month after you moved in before elevator started operating
a terrible premonition tends to attract a terrible reality
the intelligence treats it as a special entity because it was created from it you see
but if the ghost at the fujo building was your consciousness
the residents moved in tis year
but e never used tears
but the deterrent force will be in effect
honestly i dont care about how those gangs rapists died
thats the kind of ordinary neutral life tat you all lead
but did shiki really die for noting ryougi siki
the reality is tat killing someone kills yourself at the same time
the fairies can take only the memories tat you remember
so you think its the same
they cant die as umans
se might have met someone in the month you were gone
you can make a doll or a prostetic arm as realistically human like as possible
yea around nine is
right misaya oji is trying to erase the memory of kaori tacibana
the police are investigating how they died
wat is it
its the storage of all the selfisness in tis world
but the frail smile se showed me in the end was good enough for me
the police still advent figured out were they came from
right after the kaori tacibana incident
the spiral of conflict is the appropriate end for you
the sole in my heart
i shall see you again
it seems tat yet another suicide victim as been found at the fujo building
o youre ere
youve always joked like tat stuff wit a straight face
thats right it was tree years ago
there arent many people wo have such a rare name
as a result their memories still live on
right a dream about a dragonfly
you cant be fulfilled no matter wat you do
yes you can kill a person only once
wat you just swallowed is ten times more potent taen normal cannabis
thats not true as long as youre alive
o its noting
thats wat you said back when we were students
well the personality is actually ones intelligence
yea wo do i look like
o its not you
i dont avez fancy stuff like common sense
its true taking memories away means
and a body tat serves as your vessel
its the same no matter were we go
everything is recorded in the root
thats the gist of the story its as simple as they come
or why your attitude hasnt changed after all tis
terminally ill send spent over ten years in a local hospital
people can express only the feelings tat they actually possess
if it gets to the duodenum youll die in half a day
punch
but for now lets not talk about it all right
right your school emblem
i know
now ive lost a lot of things
you disappear into the forest
one of us tougt itd be fun to it her back wit a bait
thats wat you get for standing me up to go out wit siki the other day
