### Roadblocks

* accessing paired translations
  * soln: crawl sub sites, pull down en and jp subs for matched films/tv shows
* Poor translations. I.e. I've seen subs that were generated by running another language's subs through google translate
  * soln: run language model over each movie/show's corpus. if average sentance quality is below some threshold, throw it out
* En/Jp subtitle mismatch. Sometimes the srt files don't have the same number of entries, and entries don't correspond to the same times. 
  * soln: sentance alignment model. run encoder over en/jp srt files. pair up nearby sentances with similar thought vectors
